  abstract = {We explore the possibility of detecting and characterizing the warp of  the stellar disc of our Galaxy using synthetic Gaia data. The availability of proper motions and, for the brightest stars radial velocities, adds a new dimension to this study. A family of Great Circle Cell Counts methods is used. They are ideally suited to find the tilt and twist of a collection of rings, which allow us to detect and measure the warp parameters. To test them, we use random realizations of test particles which evolve in a realistic Galactic potential warped adiabatically to various final configurations. In some cases a twist is introduced additionally. The Gaia selection function, its errors model and a realistic 3D extinction map are applied to mimic three tracer populations: OB, A and red clump stars. We show how the use of kinematics improves the accuracy in the recovery of the warp parameters. The OB stars are demonstrated to be the best tracers determining the tilt angle with accuracy better than ˜0.5 up to Galactocentric distance of ˜16 kpc. Using data with good astrometric quality, the same accuracy is obtained for A-type stars up to ˜13 kpc and for red clump up to the expected stellar cut-off. Using OB stars the twist angle is recovered to within {$<$}3° for all distances.},

Several saliency methods have been proposed, often guided by visual appeal on image data. In this work, we propose an actionable methodology to evaluate what kinds of explanations a given method can and cannot provide. We find that reliance, solely, on visual assessment can be misleading. Through extensive experiments we show that some existing saliency methods are independent both of the model and of the data generating process. Consequently, methods that fail the proposed tests are inadequate for tasks that are sensitive to either data or model, such as, finding outliers in the data, explaining the relationship between inputs and outputs that the model learned, and debugging the model. We interpret our findings through an analogy with edge detection in images, a technique that requires neither training data nor model. Theory in the case of a linear model and a single-layer convolutional neural network supports our experimental findings.},

  abstract = {Interpretability of representations in both deep generative and discriminative models is highly desirable. Current methods jointly optimize an objective combining accuracy and interpretability. However, this may reduce accuracy, and is not applicable to already trained models. We propose two interpretability frameworks. First, we provide an interpretable lens for an existing model. We use a generative model which takes as input the representation in an existing (generative or discriminative) model, weakly supervised by limited side information. Applying a flexible and invertible transformation to the input leads to an interpretable representation with no loss in accuracy. We extend the approach using an active learning strategy to choose the most useful side information to obtain, allowing a human to guide what "interpretable" means. Our second framework relies on joint optimization for a representation which is both maximally informative about the side information and maximally compressive about the non-interpretable data factors. This leads to a novel perspective on the relationship between compression and regularization. We also propose a new interpretability evaluation metric based on our framework. Empirically, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three datasets using the two proposed algorithms.},

  abstract = {Likelihood-free inference provides a framework for performing rigorous Bayesian inference using only forward simulations, properly accounting for all physical and observational effects that can be successfully included in the simulations. The key challenge for likelihood-free applications in cosmology, where simulation is typically expensive, is developing methods that can achieve high-fidelity posterior inference with as few simulations as possible. Density-estimation likelihood-free inference (DELFI) methods turn inference into a density estimation task on a set of simulated data-parameter pairs, and give orders of magnitude improvements over traditional Approximate Bayesian Computation approaches to likelihood-free inference. In this paper we use neural density estimators (NDEs) to learn the likelihood function from a set of simulated datasets, with active learning to adaptively acquire simulations in the most relevant regions of parameter space on-the-fly. We demonstrate the approach on a number of cosmological case studies, showing that for typical problems high-fidelity posterior inference can be achieved with just \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(10\^3)\$ simulations or fewer. In addition to enabling efficient simulation-based inference, for simple problems where the form of the likelihood is known, DELFI offers a fast alternative to MCMC sampling, giving orders of magnitude speed-up in some cases. Finally, we introduce \textbackslash textsc\{pydelfi\} -- a flexible public implementation of DELFI with NDEs and active learning -- available at \textbackslash url\{https://github.com/justinalsing/pydelfi\}.},

  abstract = {In this paper we investigate the effects of element diffusion on the structure and evolution of low-mass helium white dwarfs. Attention is focused mainly on the occurrence of hydrogen-shell flashes induced by diffusion processes during cooling phases. Physically sound initial models with stellar masses of 0.406, 0.360, 0.327, 0.292, 0.242, 0.196, 0.169 and 0.161M\textsubscript{solar} are constructed by applying mass-loss rates at different stages of the red giant branch evolution of a solar model up to the moment the model begins to evolve to the blue part of the HR diagram. The multicomponent flow equations describing gravitational settling, and chemical and thermal diffusion are solved and the diffusion calculations are coupled to an evolutionary code. In addition, the same sequences are computed but neglecting diffusion. Results without diffusion are similar to recent results of Driebe, Schönberner, Blöcker and Herwig. We find that element diffusion strongly affects the structure and cooling history of helium white dwarfs. In particular, diffusion induces the occurrence of hydrogen-shell flashes in models with masses ranging from 0.18 to 0.41M\textsubscript{solar}, which is in sharp contrast with the situation when diffusion is neglected. In connection with further evolution, these diffusion-induced flashes lead to much thinner hydrogen envelopes, preventing stable nuclear burning from being a sizeable energy source at advanced stages of evolution. This implies much shorter cooling ages than in the case when diffusion is neglected. These new evolutionary models are discussed in light of recent observational data on some millisecond pulsar systems with white dwarf companions. In this context, we find that discrepancies between spin-down ages and the predictions of standard evolutionary models appear to be the result of ignoring element diffusion in such evolutionary models. Indeed, such discrepancies vanish when account is taken of diffusion.},

  abstract = {Large scholarly repositories are designed to provide scientists and researchers with a wealth of information that is retrieved from data present in a variety of formats. A typical scholarly document contains information in a combined layout of texts and graphic images. Common types of graphics found in these documents are scientific charts that are used to represent data values in a visual format. Experimental results are rarely described without the aid of one form of a chart or another, whether it is 2D plot, bar chart, pie chart, etc. Metadata of these graphics is usually the only content that is made available for search by user queries. By processing the image content and extracting the data represented in the graphics, search engines will be able to handle more specific queries related to the data itself. In this paper we describe a machine learning based system that extracts and recognizes the various data fields present in a bar chart for semantic labeling. Our approach comprises of a graphics and text separation and extraction phase, followed by a component role classification for both text and graphic components that are in turn used for semantic analysis and representation of the chart. The proposed system is tested on a set of over 200 bar charts extracted from over 1,000 scientific articles in PDF format.},

  abstract = {The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) is a novel transit radio telescope operating across the 400–800 MHz band. CHIME is composed of four 20 m × 100 m semicylindrical paraboloid reflectors, each of which has 256 dual-polarization feeds suspended along its axis, giving it a ≳200 deg2 field of view. This, combined with wide bandwidth, high sensitivity, and a powerful correlator, makes CHIME an excellent instrument for the detection of fast radio bursts (FRBs). The CHIME Fast Radio Burst Project (CHIME/FRB) will search beam-formed, high time and frequency resolution data in real time for FRBs in the CHIME field of view. Here we describe the CHIME/FRB back end, including the real-time FRB search and detection software pipeline, as well as the planned offline analyses. We estimate a CHIME/FRB detection rate of 2–42 FRBs sky–1 day–1 normalizing to the rate estimated at 1.4 GHz by Vander Wiel et al. Likely science outcomes of CHIME/FRB are also discussed. CHIME/FRB is currently operational in a commissioning phase, with science operations expected to commence in the latter half of 2018.},

  abstract = {Converting a noisy parallax measurement into a posterior belief over distance requires inference with a prior. Usually, this prior represents beliefs about the stellar density distribution of the Milky Way. However, multiband photometry exists for a large fraction of the Gaia-TGAS Catalog and is incredibly informative about stellar distances. Here, we use 2MASS colors for 1.4 million TGAS stars to build a noise-deconvolved empirical prior distribution for stars in color–magnitude space. This model contains no knowledge of stellar astrophysics or the Milky Way but is precise because it accurately generates a large number of noisy parallax measurements under an assumption of stationarity; that is, it is capable of combining the information from many stars. We use the Extreme Deconvolution (XD) algorithm—which is an empirical-Bayes approximation to a full-hierarchical model of the true parallax and photometry of every star—to construct this prior. The prior is combined with a TGAS likelihood to infer a precise photometric-parallax estimate and uncertainty (and full posterior) for every star. Our parallax estimates are more precise than the TGAS catalog entries by a median factor of 1.2 (14\% are more precise by a factor \textbackslash textgreater2) and they are more precise than the previous Bayesian distance estimates that use spatial priors. We validate our parallax inferences using members of the Milky Way star cluster M67, which is not visible as a cluster in the TGAS parallax estimates but appears as a cluster in our posterior parallax estimates. Our results, including a parallax posterior probability distribution function for each of 1.4 million TGAS stars, are available in companion electronic tables.},

  abstract = {Single-photon detectors in space must retain useful performance characteristics despite being bombarded with sub-atomic particles. Mitigating the effects of this space radiation is vital to enabling new space applications which require high-fidelity single-photon detection. To this end, we conducted proton radiation tests of various models of avalanche photodiodes (APDs) and one model of photomultiplier tube potentially suitable for satellite-based quantum communications. The samples were irradiated with 106 MeV protons at doses approximately equivalent to lifetimes of 0.6 , 6, 12 and 24 months in a low-Earth polar orbit. Although most detection properties were preserved, including efficiency, timing jitter and afterpulsing probability, all APD samples demonstrated significant increases in dark count rate (DCR) due to radiation-induced damage, many orders of magnitude higher than the 200 counts per second (cps) required for ground-to-satellite quantum communications. We then successfully demonstrated the mitigation of this DCR degradation through the use of deep cooling, to as low as \$-86\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\textbackslash mbox\{C\}\$ . This achieved DCR below the required 200 cps over the 24 months orbit duration. DCR was further reduced by thermal annealing at temperatures of +50 to \$+100\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\textbackslash mbox\{C\}\$ .},

  abstract = {A leading theoretical expectation for the final stages of planet formation is that disk migration should naturally drive orbits into chains of mean motion resonances (MMRs). In order to explain the dearth of MMR chains observed at Gyr ages ({$<$}1\%), this picture requires such configurations to destabilize and scramble period ratios following disk dispersal. Strikingly, the only two known stars with three or more planets younger than ≲100 Myr, HR 8799 and V1298 Tau, have been suggested to be in such MMR chains, given the orbits’ near-integer period ratios. We incorporate recent transit and radial velocity (RV) observations of the V1298 Tau system, and investigate constraints on the system’s orbital architecture imposed by requiring dynamical stability on timescales much shorter than the system’s age. We show that the recent RV mass measurement of V1298 Tau b places it within a factor of 2 of the instability limit, and that this allows us to set significantly lower limits on the eccentricity (e b ≤0.17 at 99.7\% confidence). Additionally, we rule out a resonant chain configuration for V1298 Tau at ≳99\% confidence. Thus, if the ∼23 Myr old V1298 Tau system did form as a resonant chain, it must have undergone instability and rearrangement shortly after disk dispersal. We expect that similar stability constrained characterization of future young multiplanet systems will be valuable in informing planet formation models.},

Our approach, called Multiple Regression Genetic Programming (MRGP) decouples and linearly combines a program's subexpressions via multiple regression on the target variable. The regression yields an alternate output: the prediction of the resulting multiple regression model. It is this output, over many fitness cases, that we assess for fitness, rather than the program's execution output. MRGP can be used to improve the fitness of a final evolved solution. On our experimental suite, MRGP consistently generated solutions fitter than the result of competent GP or multiple regression. When integrated into GP, inline MRGP, on the basis of equivalent computational budget, outperforms competent GP while also besting post-run MRGP. Thus MRGP's output method is shown to be superior to the output of program execution and it represents a practical, cost neutral, improvement to GP.},

  abstract = {We present a novel Auxiliary Truth enhanced Genetic Algorithm (GA) that uses logical or mathematical constraints as a means of data augmentation as well as to compute loss (in conjunction with the traditional MSE), with the aim of increasing both data efficiency and accuracy of symbolic regression (SR) algorithms. Our method, logic-guided genetic algorithm (LGGA), takes as input a set of labelled data points and auxiliary truths (ATs) (mathematical facts known a priori about the unknown function the regressor aims to learn) and outputs a specially generated and curated dataset that can be used with any SR method. Three key insights underpin our method: first, SR users often know simple ATs about the function they are trying to learn. Second, whenever an SR system produces a candidate equation inconsistent with these ATs, we can compute a counterexample to prove the inconsistency, and further, this counterexample may be used to augment the dataset and fed back to the SR system in a corrective feedback loop. Third, the value addition of these ATs is that their use in both the loss function and the data augmentation process leads to better rates of convergence, accuracy, and data efficiency. We evaluate LGGA against state-of-the-art SR tools, namely, Eureqa and TuringBot on 16 physics equations from "The Feynman Lectures on Physics" book. We find that using these SR tools in conjunction with LGGA results in them solving up to 30.0\% more equations, needing only a fraction of the amount of data compared to the same tool without LGGA, i.e., resulting in up to a 61.9\% improvement in data efficiency.},

A key element of the Astropy Project is the core package astropy, which serves as the foundation for more specialized projects and packages. In this article, we summarize key features in the core package as of the recent major release, version 5.0, and provide major updates on the Project. We then discuss supporting a broader ecosystem of interoperable packages, including connections with several astronomical observatories and missions. We also revisit the future outlook of the Astropy Project and the current status of Learn Astropy. We conclude by raising and discussing the current and future challenges facing the Project.},

  abstract = {For the vast majority of stars in the second Gaia data release, reliable distances cannot be obtained by inverting the parallax. A correct inference procedure must instead be used to account for the nonlinearity of the transformation and the asymmetry of the resulting probability distribution. Here, we infer distances to essentially all 1.33 billion stars with parallaxes published in the second Gaia data release. This is done using a weak distance prior that varies smoothly as a function of Galactic longitude and latitude according to a Galaxy model. The irreducible uncertainty in the distance estimate is characterized by the lower and upper bounds of an asymmetric confidence interval. Although more precise distances can be estimated for a subset of the stars using additional data (such as photometry), our goal is to provide purely geometric distance estimates, independent of assumptions about the physical properties of, or interstellar extinction toward, individual stars. We analyze the characteristics of the catalog and validate it using clusters. The catalog can be queried using ADQL at {$<$}A href="http://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/tap.html"{$>$}http://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/tap.html{$<$}/A{$>$} (which also hosts the Gaia catalog) and downloaded from {$<$}A href="http://www.mpia.de/\textasciitilde calj/gdr2\_distances.html"{$>$}http://www.mpia.de/\textasciitilde calj/gdr2\_distances.html{$<$}/A{$>$}.},

  abstract = {Derivatives, mostly in the form of gradients and Hessians, are ubiquitous in machine learning. Automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic differentiation or simply âautodiffâ, is a family of techniques similar to but more general than backpropagation for efficiently and accurately evaluating derivatives of numeric functions expressed as computer programs. AD is a small but established field with applications in areas including computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design optimization. Until very recently, the fields of machine learning and AD have largely been unaware of each other and, in some cases, have independently discovered each other's results. Despite its relevance, general-purpose AD has been missing from the machine learning toolbox, a situation slowly changing with its ongoing adoption under the names âdynamic computational graphsâ and âdifferentiable programmingâ. We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover applications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main implementation techniques. By precisely defining the main differentiation techniques and their interrelationships, we aim to bring clarity to the usage of the terms âautodiffâ, âautomatic differentiationâ, and âsymbolic differentiationâ as these are encountered more and more in machine learning settings.},

  abstract = {Modularity of neural networks -- both biological and artificial -- can be thought of either structurally or functionally, and the relationship between these is an open question. We show that enforcing structural modularity via sparse connectivity between two dense sub-networks which need to communicate to solve the task leads to functional specialization of the sub-networks, but only at extreme levels of sparsity. With even a moderate number of interconnections, the sub-networks become functionally entangled. Defining functional specialization is in itself a challenging problem without a universally agreed solution. To address this, we designed three different measures of specialization (based on weight masks, retraining and correlation) and found them to qualitatively agree. Our results have implications in both neuroscience and machine learning. For neuroscience, it shows that we cannot conclude that there is functional modularity simply by observing moderate levels of structural modularity: knowing the brain's connectome is not sufficient for understanding how it breaks down into functional modules. For machine learning, using structure to promote functional modularity -- which may be important for robustness and generalization -- may require extremely narrow bottlenecks between modules.},

  abstract = {The structural properties of dynamically hot galaxies are analyzed by combining central velocity dispersion, effective surface brightness, and effective radius into a new 3-space (κ), in which the axes are parameters that are physically meaningful. The degree of velocity dispersion anisotropy is also used. Hot galaxies are found to divide into groups in κ-space that closely parallel conventional morphological classifications: luminous ellipticals, compacts, bulges, bright dwarfs, and dwarf spheroidals. Most systems lie close to the fundamental plane defined by luminous Virgo and Coma ellipticals, indicating similar M/L. However, bulges have somewhat low apparent M/L, while dwarfs have slightly high M/L. The extreme M/L excess of some dwarf spheroidals sets them apart from all other dynamically hot galaxies and indicates strong domination by dark matter. A major sequence is defined by luminous ellipticals, bulges, and most compacts, which together constitute a smooth continuum in κ-space. Several properties vary smoothly with mass along this continuum, including bulge-to-disk ratio, radio properties, rotation, degree of velocity anisotropy, and "unrelaxed." or peculiar, kinematics. These trends are consistent with the idea that the final mergers leading to larger galaxies in this group were systematically more stellar (and less gaseous) than those in smaller galaxies (i.e., a "gas/stellar," or GS, continuum). Structural parameters along this continuum are compared to those predicted for cold dark matter (CDM) in κ-space. CDM predictions can be made to fit the data only if dissipation decreases significantly with increasing mass. This conclusion is consistent with a declining role for gas versus stars with increasing mass as implied by the GS continuum. A second major sequence is comprised of dwarf ellipticals and dwarf spheroidals. These systems populate an elongated locus running at right angles to the main elliptical locus. Various evidence suggests that mass loss is a major factor in hot dwarf galaxies, but the dwarf sequence cannot be simply a mass-loss sequence as it has the wrong direction in κ-space. Hot dwarfs must have come from a range of progenitor galaxies that are not visible today as hot galaxies. The existence of a primarily one-dimensional hot dwarf sequence is surprising and may be at least partially an artifact of selection effects. The most massive and the least massive hot galaxies are anisotropic separated by a strip of galaxies of intermediate mass that are isotropic rotators. The origin of anisotropy in giants and dwarfs is probably different, with that of giants likely being due to stellar mergers, and that in dwarfs possibly being due to expansion following mass loss, or a low rate of internal cloud-cloud collisions due to small collapse factors.},

Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, autoencoders, manifold learning, and deep networks.

It appears as a coherent structure in the colour-selected stellar density maps produced to search for tidal debris around nearby globular clusters. The stream is exceptionally short and narrow; it is about 2.5° long and 6 arcmin wide in projection. The colour-magnitude diagram of this object, which harbours a blue horizontal-branch, is consistent with an old and relatively metal-poor population ([Fe/H] ˜-1.3) located 9.5 ± 0.9 kpc away at (l, b) ˜ (5°, +32°), and 5.0 ± 1.0 kpc from the Galactic centre. These properties argue for a globular cluster as progenitor. The finding of such a prominent, nearby stream suggests that many streams could await discovery in the more densely populated regions of our Galaxy.},

Although these discrete decisions are easily computed in a forward manner, they break the back-propagation of computational graphs. In order to expand the scope of learning problems that can be solved in an end-to-end fashion, we propose a systematic method to transform optimizers into operations that are differentiable and never locally constant. Our approach relies on stochastically perturbed optimizers, and can be used readily within existing solvers. Their derivatives can be evaluated efficiently, and smoothness tuned via the chosen noise amplitude. We also show how this framework can be connected to a family of losses developed in structured prediction, and give theoretical guarantees for their use in learning tasks. We demonstrate experimentally the performance of our approach on various tasks.},

Julia is designed to be easy and fast. Julia questions notions generally held as "laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: 1. High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. 2. One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment, and 3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts. We introduce the Julia programming language and its design --- a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can have machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.},

Traditionally, symbolic regression methods use hand-designed strategies that do not improve with experience. In this paper, we introduce the first symbolic regression method that leverages large scale pre-training. We procedurally generate an unbounded set of equations, and simultaneously pre-train a Transformer to predict the symbolic equation from a corresponding set of input-output-pairs. At test time, we query the model on a new set of points and use its output to guide the search for the equation. We show empirically that this approach can re-discover a set of well-known physical equations, and that it improves over time with more data and compute.},

On the AGB we considered mass loss with a formula based on dynamical calculations of the atmospheres of Mira-like stars. Our results are consistent with empirical initial-final mass relations. It is shown that hot bottom burning and mass loss are closely connected. The overluminosity as well as the nucleosynthesis of hot bottom burning models can depend sensitively on mass loss. Furthermore, we discuss the influence of mass loss on the internal structure reached at the tip of the AGB, and emphasize that post-AGB timescales will depend strongly on the AGB history, i.e. on the initial mass and the applied mass-loss law.},

Concerning mass losses during the post-AGB evolution we smoothly reduced the high AGB mass-loss rates and then applied rates adapted from the radiation driven wind theory. The transition time from the AGB to the central-star region depends strongly on the treatment of mass-loss beyond the AGB. Furthermore, our calculations indicate that massive central stars can fade much more slowly than hitherto assumed. It is shown that the fading time scales and the AGB history are closely connected, and that therefore the preceding mass loss on the AGB plays an important role for the post-AGB evolution.},

These stars are generally less metal-rich than the disk, but surprisingly, half of our halo sample is comprised of stars with [\{Fe\}/\{\{H\}\}]\&gt; -1. The orbital directions of these metal-rich halo stars are preferentially aligned with the disk rotation, in sharp contrast with the intrinsically isotropic orbital distribution of the metal-poor halo stars. We find similar properties in the Latte cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy from the FIRE project. In Latte, metal-rich halo stars formed primarily inside of the solar circle, whereas lower-metallicity halo stars preferentially formed at larger distances (extending beyond the virial radius). This suggests that metal-rich halo stars in the solar neighborhood actually formed in situ within the Galactic disk, rather than having been accreted from satellite systems. These stars, currently on halo-like orbits, therefore have likely undergone substantial radial migration/heating.},

  abstract = {Cold stellar streams—produced by tidal disruptions of globular clusters—are long-lived, coherent dynamical features in the halo of the Milky Way. They hold the promise of delivering precise information about the gravitational potential, including constraints on the shape of the dark matter halo. Because of their different ages and different positions in phase space, different streams tell us different things about the Galaxy. Here we employ a Cramér─Rao lower bound (CRLB) or Fisher-matrix approach to understand the quantitative information content in (toy versions of) 11 known streams: ATLAS, GD-1, Hermus, Kwando, Orinoco, PS1A, PS1C, PS1D, PS1E, Sangarius, and Triangulum. This approach depends on a generative model, which we have developed previously, and which permits calculation of derivatives of predicted stream properties with respect to Galaxy and stream parameters. We find that in simple analytic models of the Milky Way, streams on eccentric orbits contain the most information about the halo shape. For each stream, there are near degeneracies between dark matter halo properties and parameters of the bulge, the disk, and the stream progenitor itself, but simultaneous fitting of multiple streams will constrain all parameters at the percent level. At this precision, simulated dark matter halos deviate from simple analytic parameterizations, so we add an expansion of basis functions as a first step in giving the gravitational potential more freedom. As freedom increases, the information about the halo reduces overall, and it becomes more localized to the current position of the stream. In the limit of high model freedom, a stellar stream appears to measure the local acceleration at its current position; this motivates thinking about future nonparametric approaches. The CRLB formalism also permits us to assess the value of future measurements of stellar velocities, distances, and proper motions. We show that velocities of stream stars are essential for producing competitive constraints on the distribution of dark matter.},

Using astrometric data from the Gaia second data release and photometry from the Dark Energy Survey, we demonstrate that the Jhelum stream, a stellar stream in the inner halo, is a two-dimensional structure. The spatial distribution of highly probable Jhelum members reveals a dense thin component and an associated diffuse, spatially offset component. These two spatial components have indistinguishable proper motions (at \$\textbackslash sigma\textbackslash sim1\textbackslash,\textbackslash rm mas\textbackslash,yr\^\{-1\}\$ level) and a similar ratio of blue straggler to blue horizontal branch stars, which indicates a common origin for the two components. The best-fit orbit to the narrow component (pericenter \$8\textbackslash,\textbackslash rm kpc\$, apocenter \$24\textbackslash,\textbackslash rm kpc\$), however, does not explain the wide component of the Jhelum stream. On the other hand, an older orbital wrap of Jhelum's orbit traces the Indus stream, indicating a possible connection between these two structures and additional complexity in Jhelum's formation. Substructure in the Jhelum progenitor or precession of its tidal debris in the Milky Way potential may explain the observed structure of Jhelum. Future spectroscopic data will enable discrimination between these "nature" and "nurture" formation scenarios. Jhelum adds to the growing list of cold stellar streams that display complex morphologies and promise to reveal the dynamical history of the Milky Way.},

Orbit integrations back in time show that the stream encounter could not have been caused by any known globular cluster or dwarf galaxy with a determined orbit, and mass, size, and impact parameter arguments show that it could not have been caused by a molecular cloud in the Milky Way disk. The most plausible explanation for the gap-and-spur structure is an encounter with a dark matter substructure, like those predicted to populate galactic halos in ΛCDM cosmology. However, the expected densities of ΛCDM subhalos in this mass range and in this part of the Milky Way are 2σ─3σ lower than the inferred density of the GD-1 perturber. This observation opens up the possibility that detailed observations of streams could measure the mass spectrum of dark matter substructures and even identify individual substructures and their orbits in the Galactic halo.},

  abstract = {AbstractThe convergence of online learning algorithms is analyzed using the tools of the stochastic approximation theory, and proved under very weak conditions. A general framework for online learning algorithms is first presented. This framework encompasses the most common online learning algorithms in use today, as illustrated by several examples. The stochastic approximation theory then provides general results describing the convergence of all these learning algorithms at once.IntroductionAlmost all of the early work on Learning Systems focused on online algorithms (Hebb, 1949; Rosenblatt, 1957; Widrow and Hoff, 1960; Amari, 1967; Kohonen, 1982). In these early days, the algorithmic simplicity of online algorithms was a requirement. This is still the case when it comes to handling large, real-life training sets (LeCun et al., 1989; Müller, Gunzinger and Guggenbühl, 1995).The early Recursive Adaptive Algorithms were introduced during the same years (Robbins and Monro, 1951) and very often by the same people (Widrow and Stearns, 1985). First developed in the engineering world, recursive adaptation algorithms have turned into a mathematical discipline, namely Stochastic Approximations (Kushner and Clark, 1978; Ljung and Söderström, 1983; Benveniste, Metivier and Priouret, 1990).Although both domains have enjoyed the spotlights of scientific fashion at different times and for different reasons, they essentially describe the same elementary ideas. Many authors of course have stressed this less-than-fortuitous similarity between learning algorithms and recursive adaptation algorithms (Mendel and Fu, 1970; Tsypkin, 1971).The present work builds upon this similarity. Online learning algorithms are analyzed using the stochastic approximation tools. Convergence is characterized under very weak conditions: the expected risk must be reasonably well behaved and the learning rates must decrease appropriately.},

  abstract = {Background quasars are potentially sensitive probes of galactic outflows provided that one can determine the origin of the absorbing material since both gaseous discs and strong bipolar outflows can contribute to the absorption cross-section. Using a dozen quasars passing near spectroscopically identified galaxies at z ̃ 0.1, we find that the azimuthal orientation of the quasar sightlines with strong Mg II absorption (with Wrλ2796 \&gt; 0.3Å) is bi-modal: about half the Mg II sightlines are aligned with the major axis and the other half are within α = 30° of the minor axis, suggesting that bipolar outflows can contribute to the Mg II cross-section. This bi-modality is also present in the instantaneous star formation rates (SFRs) of the hosts. For the sightlines aligned along the minor axis, a simple bi-conical wind model is indeed able to reproduce the observed Mg II kinematics and the Mg II dependence with impact parameter b, (Wrλ2796 ∝ b\textsuperscript{-1}). Using our wind model, we can directly extract key wind properties such as the de-projected outflow speed V\textsubscript{out} of the cool material traced by Mg II and the outflow rates M☉ out . The outflow speeds V\textsubscript{out} are found to be 150-300 km s\textsuperscript{-1}, i.e. of the order of the circular velocity, and smaller than the escape velocity by a factor of ̃2. The outflow rates M☉ out are typically two to three times the instantaneous SFRs. Our results demonstrate how background quasars can be used to measure wind properties with high precision.},

I examine these candidates in the context of the most massive galaxies expected in \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM-like models, wherein the stellar mass of a galaxy is limited by the available baryonic reservoir of its host dark matter halo. For a given cosmology, the abundance of dark matter halos as function of mass and redshift sets an absolute upper limit on the number density \$n({$>$}M\_\{\textbackslash star\},z)\$ and stellar mass density \$\textbackslash rho\_\{\textbackslash star\}({$>$}M\_\{\textbackslash star\},z)\$ of galaxies above a stellar mass limit of \$M\_\{\textbackslash star\}\$ at any epoch \$z\$. The reported masses of the most massive galaxy candidates at \$z \textbackslash sim 10\$ in JWST observations are in tension with these limits, indicating an issue with well-developed techniques for photometric selection of galaxies, galaxy stellar mass or effective survey volume estimates, or the \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model. That the strongest tension appears at \$z \textbackslash sim 10\$, and not (yet?) at the highest redshifts probed by JWST galaxy candidates (\$z \textbackslash sim 16-20\$), is promising for tests of the \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model using forthcoming wider-area JWST surveys.},

Recently, a powerful family of multivariate inference techniques that leverage both matrix element information and machine learning has been developed. This approach neither requires the reduction of high-dimensional data to summary statistics nor any simplifications to the underlying physics or detector response. In this paper we introduce MadMiner, a Python module that streamlines the steps involved in this procedure. Wrapping around MadGraph5\_aMC and Pythia 8, it supports almost any physics process and model. To aid phenomenological studies, the tool also wraps around Delphes 3, though it is extendable to a full Geant4-based detector simulation. We demonstrate the use of MadMiner in an example analysis of dimension-six operators in ttH production, finding that the new techniques substantially increase the sensitivity to new physics.},

  abstract = {The Cepheid period-luminosity (PL) relation is the key tool for measuring astronomical distances and for establishing the extragalactic distance scale. In particular, the local value of the Hubble constant (H0) strongly depends on Cepheid distance measurements. The recent Gaia Data Releases and other parallax measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) already enabled us to improve the accuracy of the slope (α) and intercept (β) of the PL relation. However, the dependence of this law on metallicity is still largely debated. In this paper, we combine three samples of Cepheids in the Milky Way (MW), the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) in order to derive the metallicity term (hereafter γ) of the PL relation. The recent publication of extremely precise LMC and SMC distances based on late-type detached eclipsing binary systems provides a solid anchor for the Magellanic Clouds. In the MW, we adopt Cepheid parallaxes from the early third Gaia Data Release. We derive the metallicity effect in V, I, J, H, KS, WVI, and WJK. In the KS band we report a metallicity effect of -0.221 ± 0.051 mag dex-1, the negative sign meaning that more metal-rich Cepheids are intrinsically brighter than their more metal-poor counterparts of the same pulsation period.},

  abstract = {In this article we introduce the supervised machine learning tool called Feyn. The simulation engine that powers this tool is called the QLattice. The QLattice is a supervised machine learning tool inspired by Richard Feynman's path integral formulation, that explores many potential models that solves a given problem. It formulates these models as graphs that can be interpreted as mathematical equations, allowing the user to completely decide on the trade-off between interpretability, complexity and model performance. We touch briefly upon the inner workings of the QLattice, and show how to apply the python package, Feyn, to scientific problems. We show how it differs from traditional machine learning approaches, what it has in common with them, as well as some of its commonalities with symbolic regression. We describe the benefits of this approach as opposed to black box models. To illustrate this, we go through an investigative workflow using a basic data set and show how the QLattice can help you reason about the relationships between your features and do data discovery.},

  abstract = {The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation. While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications. Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other hand, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to be invented.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} We present the second \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} data release, \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} A summary of the contents of \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 results.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} The raw data collected with the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products. \emph{Results. Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$} for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{BP{$<$}sub/{$>$} (330–680 nm) and \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{RP{$<$}sub/{$>$} (630–1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$}-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent. \emph{Conclusions. Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 represents a major achievement for the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Understanding dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled technology, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. This work develops a novel framework to discover governing equations underlying a dynamical system simply from data measurements, leveraging advances in sparsity techniques and machine learning. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. There are many critical data-driven problems, such as understanding cognition from neural recordings, inferring climate patterns, determining stability of financial markets, predicting and suppressing the spread of disease, and controlling turbulence for greener transportation and energy. With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven discovery of dynamics will continue to play an important role in these efforts.Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

  abstract = {Program synthesis is the task of automatically generating a program consistent with a specification. Recent years have seen proposal of a number of neural approaches for program synthesis, many of which adopt a sequence generation paradigm similar to neural machine translation, in which sequence-to-sequence models are trained to maximize the likelihood of known reference programs. While achieving impressive results, this strategy has two key limitations. First, it ignores Program Aliasing: the fact that many different programs may satisfy a given specification (especially with incomplete specifications such as a few input-output examples). By maximizing the likelihood of only a single reference program, it penalizes many semantically correct programs, which can adversely affect the synthesizer performance. Second, this strategy overlooks the fact that programs have a strict syntax that can be efficiently checked. To address the first limitation, we perform reinforcement learning on top of a supervised model with an objective that explicitly maximizes the likelihood of generating semantically correct programs. For addressing the second limitation, we introduce a training procedure that directly maximizes the probability of generating syntactically correct programs that fulfill the specification. We show that our contributions lead to improved accuracy of the models, especially in cases where the training data is limited.},

  abstract = {Genetic Programming (GP) is a dynamic field of research where empirical testing plays an important role in validating new ideas and algorithms. The ability to easily prototype new algorithms by reusing key components and quickly obtain results is therefore important for the researcher. In this paper we introduce Operon, a C++ GP framework focused on performance, modularity and usability, featuring an efficient linear tree encoding and a scalable concurrency model where each logical thread is responsible for generating a new individual. We model the GP evolutionary process around the concept of an offspring generator, a streaming operator that defines how new individuals are obtained. The approach allows different algorithmic variants to be expressed using high-level constructs within the same generational basic loop. The evaluation routine supports both scalar and dual numbers, making it possible to calculate model derivatives via automatic differentiation. This functionality allows seamless integration with gradient-based local search approaches. We discuss the design choices behind the proposed framework and compare against two other popular GP frameworks, DEAP and HeuristicLab. We empirically show that Operon is competitive in terms of solution quality, while being able to generate results significantly faster.},

  abstract = {We present a review of nucleosynthesis in AGB stars outlining the development of theoretical models and their relationship to observations. We focus on the new high resolution codes with improved opacities, which recently succeeded in accounting for the third dredge-up. This opens the possibility of understanding low luminosity C stars (enriched in s-elements) as the normal outcome of AGB evolution, characterized by production of 12C and neutron-rich nuclei in the He intershell and by mass loss from strong stellar winds. Neutron captures in AGB stars are driven by two reactions: 13C([α],n)16O, which provides the bulk of the neutron flux at low neutron densities (Nn [\&lt;=] 107 n/cm3), and 22Ne([α],n)25Mg, which is mildly activated at higher temperatures and mainly affects the production of s-nuclei depending on reaction branchings. The first reaction is now known to occur in the radiative interpulse phase, immediately below the region previously homogenized by third dredge-up. The second reaction occurs during the convective thermal pulses. The resulting nucleosynthesis phenomena are rather complex and rule out any analytical approximation (exponential distribution of neutron fluences). Nucleosynthesis in AGB stars, modeled at different metallicities, account for several observational constraints, coming from a wide spectrum of sources: evolved red giants rich in s-elements, unevolved stars at different metallicities, presolar grains recovered from meteorites, and the abundances of s-process isotopes in the solar system. In particular, a good reproduction of the solar system main component is obtained as a result of Galactic chemical evolution that mixes the outputs of AGB stars of different stellar generations, born with different metallicities and producing different patterns of s-process nuclei. The main solar s-process pattern is thus not considered to be the result of a standard archetypal s-process occurring in all stars. Concerning the 13C neutron source, its synthesis requires penetration of small amounts of protons below the convective envelope, where they are captured by the abundant 12C forming a 13C-rich pocket. This penetration cannot be modeled in current evolutionary codes, but is treated as a free parameter. Future hydrodynamical studies of time dependent mixing will be required to attack this problem. Evidence of other insufficiencies in the current mixing algorithms is common throughout the evolution of low and intermediate mass stars, as is shown by the inadequacy of stellar models in reproducing the observations of CNO isotopes in red giants and in circumstellar dust grains. These observations require some circulation of matter between the bottom of convective envelopes and regions close to the H-burning shell (cool bottom processing). AGB stars are also discussed in the light of their possible contribution to the inventory of short-lived radioactivities that were found to be alive in the early solar system. We show that the pollution of the protosolar nebula by a close-by AGB star may account for concordant abundances of 26Al, 41Ca, 60Fe, and 107Pd. The AGB star must have undergone a very small neutron exposure, and be of small initial mass ([Image]). There is a shortage of 26Al in such models, that however remains within the large uncertainties of crucial reaction rates. The net 26Al production problem requires further investigation.},

  abstract = {Context: The growing body of spectral observations of the extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars in the Galactic Halo provides constraints on theoretical studies of the chemical and stellar evolution of the early Universe. {$<$}BR /{$>$}Aims: To calculate yields for EMP stars for use in chemical evolution calculations and to test whether such models can account for some of the recent abundance observations of EMP stars, in particular the highly C-rich EMP (CEMP) halo stars. {$<$}BR /{$>$}Methods: We modify an existing 1D stellar structure code to include time-dependent mixing in a diffusion approximation. Using this code and a post-processing nucleosynthesis code we calculate the structural evolution and nucleosynthesis of a grid of models covering the metallicity range: -6.5 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ -3.0 (plus Z = 0), and mass range: 0.85 ≤ M ≤ 3.0 M\_☉, amounting to 20 stars in total. {$<$}BR /{$>$}Results: Many of the models experience violent nuclear burning episodes not seen at higher metallicities. We refer to these events as “Dual Flashes” since they are characterised by nearly simultaneous peaks in both hydrogen and helium burning. These events have been reported by previous studies. Some of the material processed by the Dual Flashes is dredged up causing significant surface pollution with a distinct chemical composition. We have calculated the entire evolution of the Z=0 and EMP models, from the ZAMS to the end of the TPAGB, including extensive nucleosynthesis. In this paper, the first of a series describing and analysing this large data set, we present the resulting stellar yields. Although subject to many uncertainties these are, as far as we are aware, the only yields currently available in this mass and metallicity range. We also analyse the yields in terms of C and N, comparing them to the observed CEMP abundances. At the lowest metallicities ([Fe/H] ≲ -4.0) we find the yields to contain \textasciitilde{} 1 to 2 dex too much carbon, in agreement with all previous studies. At higher metallicities ([Fe/H] \textasciitilde{} -3.0), where the observed data set is much larger, all our models produce yields with [C/Fe] values consistent with those observed in the most C-rich CEMPs. However it is only the low-mass models that undergo the Dual Shell Flash (which occurs at the start of the TPAGB) that can best reproduce the C and N observations. Normal Third Dredge-Up can not reproduce the observations because at these metallicities intermediate mass models (M ≳ 2 M\_☉) suffer HBB which converts the C to N thus lowering [C/N] well below the observations, whilst if TDU were to occur in the low-mass (M ≤ 1 M\_☉) models (we do not find it to occur in our models), the yields would be expected to be C-rich only, which is at odds with the “dual pollution” of C and N generally observed in the CEMPs. Interestingly events similar to the EMP Dual Flashes have been proposed to explain objects similarly containing a dual pollution of C and N - the “Blue Hook” stars and the “Born Again AGB” stars. We also find that the proportion of CEMP stars should continue to increase at lower metallicities, based on the results that some of the low mass EMP models already have polluted surfaces by the HB phase, and that there are more C-producing evolutionary episodes at these metallicities. Finally we note that there is a need for multidimensional fluid dynamics calculations of the Dual Flash events, to ascertain whether the overproduction of C and N at ultra-low metallicities found by all studies is an artifact of the 1D treatment.

  abstract = {The design and manipulation of typefaces and fonts is an area requiring substantial expertise; it can take many years of study to become a proficient typographer. At the same time, the use of typefaces is ubiquitous; there are many users who, while not experts, would like to be more involved in tweaking or changing existing fonts without suffering the learning curve of professional typography packages. Given the wealth of fonts that are available today, we would like to exploit the expertise used to produce these fonts, and to enable everyday users to create, explore, and edit fonts. To this end, we build a generative manifold of standard fonts. Every location on the manifold corresponds to a unique and novel typeface, and is obtained by learning a non-linear mapping that intelligently interpolates and extrapolates existing fonts. Using the manifold, we can smoothly interpolate and move between existing fonts. We can also use the manifold as a constraint that makes a variety of new applications possible. For instance, when editing a single character, we can update all the other glyphs in a font simultaneously to keep them compatible with our changes.},

  abstract = {Turbulence is ubiquitous in astrophysics, ranging from cosmology, interstellar medium to stars, supernovae, accretion disks, etc. Large scales and small viscosities combine to form large Reynolds numbers. Because it is not possible in a single article to review all the above scenarios, we limit ourselves to stars, in which thermal instabilities give rise to turbulent convection as the dominant heat transport mechanism. (Accretion disks, where shear instabilities dominate the outward transport of angular momentum, will be the subject of a second article, planned for Volume 31.) Because of the lack of a satisfactory theory, turbulence constitutes a bottleneck that prevents astrophysical models from being fully predictive. Because continued use of phenomenological turbulence expressions would make astrophysical models perennially unpredictive, a way must be found to make astrophysical models as prognostic as possible. In addition to the difficulties brought about by turbulence, astrophysical settings introduce “malicious conditions,” of which the most refractory to a satisfactory quantification are compressibility (caused by the large density excursions that characterize convective zones in stars) and rotation. Basic understanding of how they affect turbulence in general is still rather sketchy. Reasons for the choice of stars and accretion disks as prototype examples are the following: The underlying instabilities are very basic; laboratory and direct numerical simulations data help constrain theoretical models; and new observational data, especially from helioseismology, help discriminate among different models with unprecedented accuracy.},

We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8 data to extend the density measurements of the trailing star stream to 23 deg distance from the cluster, at which point the stream runs off the edge of the available sky coverage. The size and the number of gaps in the stream are measured using a filter which approximates the structure of the gaps found in stream simulations. We find 5 gaps that are at least 99\% confidence detections with about a dozen gaps at 90\% confidence. The statistical significance of a gap is estimated using bootstrap resampling of the control regions on either side of the stream. The density minimum closest to the cluster is likely the result of the epicyclic orbits of the tidal outflow and has been discounted. To create the number of 99\% confidence gaps per unit length at the mean age of the stream requires a halo population of nearly a thousand dark matter sub-halos with peak circular velocities above 1 km s\textsuperscript{-1} within 30 kpc of the galactic center. These numbers are a factor of about three below cold stream simulation at this sub-halo mass or velocity but, given the uncertainties in both measurement and more realistic warm stream modeling, are in substantial agreement with the LCDM prediction.},

  abstract = {Thin halo star streams originate from the evaporation of globular clusters and therefore provide information about the early epoch globular cluster population. The observed tidal tails from halo globular clusters in the Milky Way are much shorter than expected from a star cluster orbiting for 10 Gyr. The discrepancy is likely the result of the assumptions that nearly nonevolving clusters have been orbiting in a nonevolving galactic halo for a Hubble time. As a first step toward more realistic stream histories, a toy model that combines an idealized merger model with a simplified model of the internal collisional relaxation of individual star clusters is developed. On average, the resulting stream velocity dispersion increases with distance, causing the density of the stream to decline with distance. The accretion time sets an upper limit to the length of the readily visible stream, with the internal evolution of the cluster usually playing the dominant role in limiting the sky visibility of the older parts of streams. Nevertheless, the high surface density segment of the stellar streams created from the evaporation of the more massive globular clusters should all be visible in low-obscuration parts of the sky if closer than about 30 kpc. The Pan-STARRS1 halo volume is used to compare the numbers of halo streams and globular clusters.},

We investigate the stability of systems of more than two planets using numerical integrations. We find that systems with Δ {$<$} 10 are always unstable, with the time,t, of first close encounter given approximately by logt=bΔ +c, wherebandcare constants. It is likely that systems with Δ {$>$} 10 are also unstable. The slopebdepends weakly on the number of planets, but is independent of planetary mass,m, if we measure Δ in units that are proportional tom1/4rather than the usualRH∝m1/3. Instability in multi-planet systems arises because energy and angular momentum are no longer conserved within each two-planet subsystem due to perturbations by the additional planet(s). These results suggest that planetary embryos will not become isolated prior to the final stage of terrestrial-planet formation simply due to a failure to achieve close encounters. Other factors leading to isolation cannot be ruled out at this stage.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is redefining what is possible in data-intensive fields of science and engineering. However, applying ML to problems in the physical sciences comes with a unique set of challenges: scientists want physically interpretable models that can (i) generalize to predict previously unobserved behaviors, (ii) provide effective forecasting predictions (extrapolation), and (iii) be certifiable. Autonomous systems will necessarily interact with changing and uncertain environments, motivating the need for models that can accurately extrapolate based on physical principles (e.g. Newton's universal second law for classical mechanics, F = ma). Standard ML approaches have shown impressive performance for predicting dynamics in an interpolatory regime, but the resulting models often lack interpretability and fail to generalize. We build on a sparse regression framework that discovers governing dynamical systems models from data, selecting relevant terms in the dynamics from a library of possible functions. Our critically enabling innovation introduces a relaxed version of a sparse optimization framework that allows the use of non-convex sparsity promoting regularization functions and addresses three open challenges in scientific problems and data sets: (i) robust handling of outliers and corrupt data within noisy sensor measurements, (ii) parametric dependencies in candidate library functions, and (iii) the imposition of physical constraints. By explicitly addressing these open challenges, the integrated and unified algorithm developed provides a significant advancement over current state-of-the-art sparse model discovery methods. We show that the approach discovers parsimonious dynamical models on several example systems. This flexible approach can be tailored to the unique challenges associated with a wide range of applications and data sets, providing a powerful ML-based framework for learning governing models for physical systems from data.},

CRNNs take advantage of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for local feature extraction and recurrent neural networks for temporal summarisation of the extracted features. We compare CRNN with three CNN structures that have been used for music tagging while controlling the number of parameters with respect to their performance and training time per sample. Overall, we found that CRNNs show a strong performance with respect to the number of parameter and training time, indicating the effectiveness of its hybrid structure in music feature extraction and feature summarisation.},

In this work, we present models with solar-scaled abundance ratios covering a wide range of ages (5≤slant \{log\}(\{Age\}) [\{year\}]≤slant 10.3), masses (0.1≤slant M/\{M\}⊙ ≤slant 300), and metallicities (-2.0≤slant [\{\{Z\}\}/\{\{H\}\}]≤slant 0.5). The models are self-consistently and continuously evolved from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to the end of hydrogen burning, the white dwarf cooling sequence, or the end of carbon burning, depending on the initial mass. We also provide a grid of models evolved from the PMS to the end of core helium burning for -4.0≤slant [\{\{Z\}\}/\{\{H\}\}]\textbackslash lt -2.0. We showcase extensive comparisons with observational constraints as well as with some of the most widely used existing models in the literature. The evolutionary tracks and isochrones can be downloaded from the project website at http://waps.cfa.harvard.edu/MIST/.},

  abstract = {Many real world learning tasks involve complex or hard-to-specify objectives, and using an easier-to-specify proxy can lead to poor performance or misaligned behavior. One solution is to have humans provide a training signal by demonstrating or judging performance, but this approach fails if the task is too complicated for a human to directly evaluate. We propose Iterated Amplification, an alternative training strategy which progressively builds up a training signal for difficult problems by combining solutions to easier subproblems. Iterated Amplification is closely related to Expert Iteration (Anthony et al., 2017; Silver et al., 2017), except that it uses no external reward function. We present results in algorithmic environments, showing that Iterated Amplification can efficiently learn complex behaviors.},

  abstract = {An artificial viscosity is described, which functions as an effective subgrid-scale model for both high and low Mach number flows. The model employs a bulk viscosity for treating shocks and a shear viscosity for treating turbulence. Each of the viscosities contains an empirical constant; however, the constants do not require adjustment from flow to flow. A polyharmonic operator, applied to the strain rate, imparts spectral-like behavior to the model, thus eliminating the need for ad hoc limiters and/or ''dynamic procedures'' to turn off the model in smooth regions. The model gives excellent results for ShuÕs problem, NohÕs problem and decaying turbulence. Over half a century ago, von Neumann and Richtmyer [1] introduced the idea of adding artificial viscosity to the Euler equations in order to help stabilize shock calculations. The ideas of von Neumann, regarding artificial viscosity, influenced Smagorinsky in his development of a subgrid-scale model designed to match the Kolmogorov spectrum for atmospheric turbulence [2,3]. Since that time, numerous artificial viscosity formulations have been proposed for simulating both shocks and turbulence [4-10]. Over the years however, a rift has developed between shock capturing (monotonicity-preserving) and turbulence-capturing (large-eddy simulation) methods. Artificial viscosities for shock capturing typically depend on sound speed, which makes them unsuitable for low Mach number flows. On the other hand, subgrid-scale models, cus-tomized for incompressible turbulence, usually fail to capture shocks in a monotonic fashion. A unified treatment of flow discontinuities and turbulent subgrid scales was previously pursued by Adams and Stolz [11], who employed a regularized approximate deconvolution technique to simulate shocks in one dimension. The purpose of this paper is to introduce an artificial viscosity suitable for computing},

One common approach is to manually create mathematical models of natural phenomena using domain knowledge, then fit these models to data. In contrast, machine-learning algorithms automate the construction of accurate data-driven models while consuming large amounts of data. Ensuring that such models are consistent with existing knowledge is an open problem. We develop a method for combining logical reasoning with symbolic regression, enabling principled derivations of models of natural phenomena. We demonstrate these concepts for Kepler's third law of planetary motion, Einstein's relativistic time-dilation law, and Langmuir's theory of adsorption, automatically connecting experimental data with background theory in each case. We show that laws can be discovered from few data points when using formal logical reasoning to distinguish the correct formula from a set of plausible formulas that have similar error on the data. The combination of reasoning with machine learning provides generalizable insights into key aspects of natural phenomena. We envision that this combination will enable derivable discovery of fundamental laws of science. We believe that this is a crucial first step for connecting the missing links in automating the scientific method.},

However, this comes at the cost of complex, black-boxed models that are unable to extrapolate beyond the domain of the training dataset, conflicting with goals of expressing physical laws or building human-readable programs. In this paper, we introduce OccamNet, a neural network model that can find interpretable, compact and sparse solutions for fitting data, \textbackslash `\{a\} la Occam's razor. Our model defines a probability distribution over a non-differentiable function space, and we introduce an optimization method that samples functions and updates the weights based on cross-entropy matching in an evolutionary strategy: we train by biasing the probability mass towards better fitting solutions. We demonstrate that we can fit a variety of algorithms, ranging from simple analytic functions through recursive programs to even simple image classification. Our method takes minimal memory footprint, does not require AI accelerators for efficient training, fits complicated functions in minutes of training on a single CPU, and demonstrates significant performance gains when scaled on GPU. Our implementation, demonstrations and instructions for reproducing the experiments are available at https://github.com/AllanSCosta/occam-net.},

As a result, the regression problem can search many nonlinear functional forms using only the specification of simple mathematical operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, among others. Currently, state-of-the-art symbolic regression methods leverage genetic algorithms and adaptive programming techniques. Genetic algorithms lack optimality certifications and are typically stochastic in nature. In contrast, we propose an optimization formulation for the rigorous deterministic optimization of the symbolic regression problem. We present a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation to solve the symbolic regression problem as well as several alternative models to eliminate redundancies and symmetries. We demonstrate this symbolic regression technique using an array of experiments based upon literature instances. We then use a set of 24 MINLPs from symbolic regression to compare the performance of five local and five global MINLP solvers. Finally, we use larger instances to demonstrate that a portfolio of models provides an effective solution mechanism for problems of the size typically addressed in the symbolic regression literature.},

The framework is generalizable, but initially it emphasizes the needs of high-throughput radio astronomy pipelines, such as the ability to process data buffers as if they were continuous streams, the capacity to partition processing into distinct data sequences (e.g. separate observations), and the ability to extract specific intervals from buffered data. Computing blocks in the library are designed for applications such as interferometry, pulsar dedispersion and timing, and transient search pipelines. We describe the design and implementation of the Bifrost framework and demonstrate its use as the backbone in the correlation and beamforming back end of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) station in the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, NM.},

We find the correct known equations, including force laws and Hamiltonians, can be extracted from the neural network. We then apply our method to a non-trivial cosmology example-a detailed dark matter simulation-and discover a new analytic formula which can predict the concentration of dark matter from the mass distribution of nearby cosmic structures. The symbolic expressions extracted from the GNN using our technique also generalized to out-of-distribution data better than the GNN itself.

Latent variables in a deep neural network are difficult to interpret because there are often many redundant such variables, and each relies on the interactions of many input features. Existing sparsity strategies target the parameters of a neural network, but do not guarantee a sparse dependency mapping from inputs to outputs, and as one can show empirically, often result in latent features which are dependent on the complex interactions of many input features. Our architecture and regularization scheme allows one to minimize the dependency of each latent feature in a deep network, making them much easier to interpret. This network can be used as a drop-in replacement for any multi-layer perceptron, and allows the user to fine-tune the dependencies of each output feature on each input feature. We show that this can greatly increase the applicability of symbolic regression-based Explainable AI approaches: for the first time, we show that we can recover the majority of the compressible Euler fluid equations from a trained graph neural network, purely by studying its internal latent features as trained with our model.},

We motivate and test this proposal with a large-scale summarization problem for cosmological simulations: one wishes to predict global properties of the universe via a set of observed structures distributed throughout space. We demonstrate comparable performance to a sum-pool and mean-pool operation over a range of hyperparameters for this problem. In doing so, we also increase the accuracy of traditional forecasting methods from 20\% error using our dataset down to 13\%, strengthening the argument for using such methods in Cosmology. We conclude by using our operator to symbolically discover an optimal cosmological feature for cosmic voids (which was not possible with traditional pooling operators) and discuss potential physical connections.},

By staying closer to standard techniques, one can make more explicit connections with the learned functional form used by the model. We motivate and test this proposal with a large-scale summarization problem for cosmological simulations: one wishes to predict global properties of the universe via a set of observed structures distributed throughout space. We demonstrate comparable performance to a sum-pool and mean-pool operation over a range of hyperparameters for this problem. In doing so, we also increase the accuracy of traditional forecasting methods from 20\% error using our dataset down to 13\%, strengthening the argument for using such methods in Cosmology. We conclude by using our operator to symbolically discover an optimal cosmological feature for cosmic voids (which was not possible with traditional pooling operators) and discuss potential physical connections.},

  abstract = {Accurate models of the world are built upon notions of its underlying symmetries. In physics, these symmetries correspond to conservation laws, such as for energy and momentum. Yet even though neural network models see increasing use in the physical sciences, they struggle to learn these symmetries. In this paper, we propose Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs), which can parameterize arbitrary Lagrangians using neural networks. In contrast to models that learn Hamiltonians, LNNs do not require canonical coordinates, and thus perform well in situations where canonical momenta are unknown or difficult to compute. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not restrict the functional form of learned energies and will produce energy-conserving models for a variety of tasks. We test our approach on a double pendulum and a relativistic particle, demonstrating energy conservation where a baseline approach incurs dissipation and modeling relativity without canonical coordinates where a Hamiltonian approach fails. Finally, we show how this model can be applied to graphs and continuous systems using a Lagrangian Graph Network, and demonstrate it on the 1D wave equation.},

Our experiments show that our graph network models, which implement this inductive bias, can learn message representations equivalent to the true force vector when trained on n-body gravitational and spring-like simulations. We use symbolic regression to fit explicit algebraic equations to our trained model's message function and recover the symbolic form of Newton's law of gravitation without prior knowledge. We also show that our model generalizes better at inference time to systems with more bodies than had been experienced during training. Our approach is extensible, in principle, to any unknown interaction law learned by a graph network, and offers a valuable technique for interpreting and inferring explicit causal theories about the world from implicit knowledge captured by deep learning.},

Dust estimation and dereddening is done iteratively inside the model and without prior distance information, using the Bayestar map. The signal-to-noise (precision) of distance measurements improves on average by more than 48\% over the raw Gaia data, and we also demonstrate how the accuracy of distances have improved over other models, especially in the noisy-parallax regime. Applications are discussed, including significantly improved Milky Way disk separation and substructure detection. We conclude with a discussion of future work, which exploits the normalizing flow architecture to allow us to exactly marginalize over missing photometry, enabling the inclusion of many surveys without losing coverage.},

Our algorithm is motivated by a problem in modern astronomy, where one needs to select-based on limited initial information-among \$10\^9\$ galaxies those whose detailed measurement will lead to optimal inference of the composition of the universe. Our technique presents a way of flexibly learning an allocation strategy by only requiring forward simulators for the physics of interest and the measurement process.

The average error is just 2.86\% on the first 1.7 million knots, which represents a large improvement over previous formulas of this kind. To find the approximation formula, we use layer-wise relevance propagation to reverse engineer a black box neural network which achieves a similar average error for the same approximation task when trained on 10\% of the total dataset. The particular roots of unity which appear in our analysis cannot be written as e2πi/(k+2) with integer k; therefore, the relevant Jones polynomial evaluations are not given by unknot-normalized expectation values of Wilson loop operators in conventional SU(2) Chern-Simons theory with level k. Instead, they correspond to an analytic continuation of such expectation values to fractional level. We briefly review the continuation procedure and comment on the presence of certain Lefschetz thimbles, to which our approximation formula is sensitive, in the analytically continued Chern-Simons integration cycle.},

Classical solvers of turbulence simulation generally operate on finer grids and are computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose the Turbulence Neural Transformer (TNT), which is a learned simulator based on the transformer architecture, to predict turbulent dynamics on coarsened grids. TNT extends the positional embeddings of vanilla transformers to a spatiotemporal setting to learn the representation in the 3D time-series domain, and applies Temporal Mutual Self-Attention (TMSA), which captures adjacent dependencies, to extract deep and dynamic features. TNT is capable of generating comparatively long-range predictions stably and accurately, and we show that TNT outperforms the state-of-the-art U-net simulator on several metrics. We also test the model performance with different components removed and evaluate robustness to different initial conditions. Although more experiments are needed, we conclude that TNT has great potential to outperform existing solvers and generalize to additional simulation datasets.},

In this paper, we train Transformers to infer the function or recurrence relation underlying sequences of integers or floats, a typical task in human IQ tests which has hardly been tackled in the machine learning literature. We evaluate our integer model on a subset of OEIS sequences, and show that it outperforms built-in Mathematica functions for recurrence prediction. We also demonstrate that our float model is able to yield informative approximations of out-of-vocabulary functions and constants, e.g. \$\textbackslash operatorname\{bessel0\}(x)\textbackslash approx \textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash sin(x)+\textbackslash cos(x)\}\{\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash pi x\}\}\$ and \$1.644934\textbackslash approx \textbackslash pi\^2/6\$.

A total of 6720 uniform grid intervals were used, with sub-grid scale effects simulated with eddy coefficients proportional to the local velocity deformation. The agreement of calculated statistics against those measured by Laufer ranges from good to marginal. The eddy shapes are examined, and only the u-component, longitudinal eddies are found to be elongated in the downstream direction. However, the lateral v eddies have distinct downstream tilts. The turbulence energy balance is examined, including the separate effects of vertical diffusion of pressure and local kinetic energy.It is concluded that the numerical approach to the problem of turbulence at large Reynolds numbers is already profitable, with increased accuracy to be expected with modest increase of numerical resolution.},

With the large amount of data gathered on these phenomena the data intensive paradigm could begin to challenge more traditional approaches elaborated over the years in fields like maths or physics. However, despite considerable successes in a variety of application domains, the machine learning field is not yet ready to handle the level of complexity required by such problems. Using an example application, namely Sea Surface Temperature Prediction, we show how general background knowledge gained from physics could be used as a guideline for designing efficient Deep Learning models. In order to motivate the approach and to assess its generality we demonstrate a formal link between the solution of a class of differential equations underlying a large family of physical phenomena and the proposed model. Experiments and comparison with series of baselines including a state of the art numerical approach is then provided.},

In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN/sup 2/) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed.},

  abstract = {Symbolic Regression tries to find a mathematical expression that describes the relationship of a set of explanatory variables to a measured variable. The main objective is to find a model that minimizes the error and, optionally, that also minimizes the expression size. A smaller expression can be seen as an interpretable model considered a reliable decision model. This is often performed with Genetic Programming which represents their solution as expression trees. The shortcoming of this algorithm lies on this representation that defines a rugged search space and contains expressions of any size and difficulty. These pose as a challenge to find the optimal solution under computational constraints. This paper introduces a new data structure, called Interaction-Transformation (IT), that constrains the search space in order to exclude a region of larger and more complicated expressions. In order to test this data structure, it was also introduced an heuristic called SymTree. The obtained results show evidence that SymTree are capable of obtaining the optimal solution whenever the target function is within the search space of the IT data structure and competitive results when it is not. Overall, the algorithm found a good compromise between accuracy and simplicity for all the generated models.},

The main attraction of this approach is that it returns an interpretable model that can be insightful to users. Historically, the majority of algorithms for symbolic regression have been based on evolutionary algorithms. However, there has been a recent surge of new proposals that instead utilize approaches such as enumeration algorithms, mixed linear integer programming, neural networks, and Bayesian optimization. In order to assess how well these new approaches behave on a set of common challenges often faced in real-world data, we hosted a competition at the 2022 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference consisting of different synthetic and real-world datasets which were blind to entrants. For the real-world track, we assessed interpretability in a realistic way by using a domain expert to judge the trustworthiness of candidate models.We present an in-depth analysis of the results obtained in this competition, discuss current challenges of symbolic regression algorithms and highlight possible improvements for future competitions.},

  abstract = {To extract information from the clustering of galaxies on non-linear scales, we need to model the connection between galaxies and halos accurately and in a flexible manner. Standard halo occupation distribution (HOD) models make the assumption that the galaxy occupation in a halo is a function of only its mass, however, in reality, the occupation can depend on various other parameters including halo concentration, assembly history, environment, spin, etc. Using the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamic simulation as our target, we show that machine learning tools can be used to capture this high-dimensional dependence and provide more accurate galaxy occupation models. Specifically, we use a random forest regressor to identify which secondary halo parameters best model the galaxy-halo connection and symbolic regression to augment the standard HOD model with simple equations capturing the dependence on those parameters, namely the local environmental overdensity and shear, at the location of a halo. This not only provides insights into the galaxy-formation relationship but, more importantly, improves the clustering statistics of the modeled galaxies significantly. Our approach demonstrates that machine learning tools can help us better understand and model the galaxy-halo connection, and are therefore useful for galaxy formation and cosmology studies from upcoming galaxy surveys.},

  abstract = {Quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms (QIEAs) exploit principles of quantum mechanics to improve the performance of classical evolutionary algorithms. This paper describes the latest version of a QIEA model (“Quantum-Inspired Linear Genetic Programming” - QILGP) to evolve machine code programs. QILGP is inspired on multilevel quantum systems and its operation is based on quantum individuals, which represent a superposition of all programs of search space (solutions). Symbolic regression problems and the current more efficient model to evolve machine code (AIMGP) are used in comparative tests, which aim to evaluate the performance impact of introducing demes (subpopulations) and a limited migration strategy in this version of QILGP. It outperforms AIMGP by obtaining better solutions with fewer parameters and operators. The performance improvement achieved by this latest version of QILGP encourages its ongoing and future enhancements. Thus, this paper concludes that the quantum inspiration paradigm can be a competitive approach to evolve programs more efficiently.},

  abstract = {Context. Cosmic rays (CRs) are transported out of the galaxy by diffusion and advection due to streaming along magnetic field lines and resonant scattering off self-excited MHD waves. Thus momentum is transferred to the plasma via the frozen-in waves as a mediator assisting the thermal pressure in driving a galactic wind. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: The bulk of the Galactic CRs (GCRs) are accelerated by shock waves generated in supernova remnants (SNRs), a significant fraction of which occur in OB associations on a timescale of several 10\textsuperscript{7} years. We examine the effect of changing boundary conditions at the base of the galactic wind due to sequential SN explosions on the outflow. Thus pressure waves will steepen into shock waves leading to in situ post-acceleration of GCRs. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We performed hydrodynamical simulations of galactic winds in flux tube geometry appropriate for disk galaxies, describing the CR diffusive-advective transport in a hydrodynamical fashion (by taking appropriate moments of the Fokker-Planck equation) along with the energy exchange with self-generated MHD waves. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: Our time-dependent CR hydrodynamic simulations confirm the existence of time asymptotic outflow solutions (for constant boundary conditions), which are in excellent the agreement with the steady state galactic wind solutions described by Breitschwerdt et al. (1991, A\&amp;A, 245, 79). It is also found that high-energy particles escaping from the Galaxy and having a power-law distribution in energy (∝E\textsuperscript{-2.7}) similar to the Milky Way with an upper energy cut-off at \textasciitilde 10\textsuperscript{15} eV are subjected to efficient and rapid post-SNR acceleration in the lower galactic halo up to energies of 10\textsuperscript{17}-10\textsuperscript{18} eV by multiple shock waves propagating through the halo. The particles can gain energy within less than 3 kpc from the galactic plane corresponding to flow times less than 5 × 10\textsuperscript{6} years. Since particles are advected downstream of the shocks, i.e. towards the galactic disk, they should be easily observable, and their flux should be fairly isotropic. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: The mechanism described here offers a natural and elegant solution to explain the power-law distribution of CRs between the "knee" and the "ankle".},

This method accommodates a broad range of stellar types, from substellar objects to high-mass stars, and phases of evolution, from the pre-main sequence to the white dwarf cooling sequence. I discuss situations in which stellar physics leads to departures from the otherwise monotonic relation between initial stellar mass and lifetime, and how these may be dealt with in isochrone construction. I close with convergence tests and recommendations for the number of points in the uniform basis and the mass between tracks in the original grid required to achieve a certain level accuracy in the resulting isochrones. The programs that implement these methods are free and open-source; they may be obtained from the project webpage.1},

We introduce the random edge graph neural network (REGNN), which performs convolutions over random graphs formed by the fading interference patterns in the wireless network. The REGNN-based allocation policies are shown to retain an important permutation equivariance property that makes them amenable to transference to different networks. We further present an unsupervised model-free primal-dual learning algorithm to train the weights of the REGNN. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the strong performance REGNNs obtain relative to heuristic benchmarks and their transference capabilities.},

  abstract = {Turbulence affects the structure and motions of nearly all temperature and density regimes in the interstellar gas. This two-part review summarizes the observations, theory, and simulations of interstellar turbulence and their implications for many fields of astrophysics. The first part begins with diagnostics for turbulence that have been applied to the cool interstellar medium and highlights their main results. The energy sources for interstellar turbulence are then summarized along with numerical estimates for their power input. Supernovae and superbubbles dominate the total power, but many other sources spanning a large range of scales, from swing-amplified gravitational instabilities to cosmic ray streaming, all contribute in some way. Turbulence theory is considered in detail, including the basic fluid equations, solenoidal and compressible modes, global inviscid quadratic invariants, scaling arguments for the power spectrum, phenomenological models for the scaling of higher-order structure functions, the direction and locality of energy transfer and cascade, velocity probability distributions, and turbulent pressure. We emphasize expected differences between incompressible and compressible turbulence. Theories of magnetic turbulence on scales smaller than the collision mean free path are included, as are theories of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and their various proposals for power spectra. Numerical simulations of interstellar turbulence are reviewed. Models have reproduced the basic features of the observed scaling relations, predicted fast decay rates for supersonic MHD turbulence, and derived probability distribution functions for density. Thermal instabilities and thermal phases have a new interpretation in a supersonically turbulent medium. Large-scale models with various combinations of self-gravity, magnetic fields, supernovae, and star formation are beginning to resemble the observed interstellar medium in morphology and statistical properties. The role of self-gravity in turbulent gas evolution is clarified, leading to new paradigms for the formation of star clusters, the stellar mass function, the origin of stellar rotation and binary stars, and the effects of magnetic fields. The review ends with a reflection on the progress that has been made in our understanding of the interstellar medium and offers a list of outstanding problems.},

  abstract = {Ample observational capabilities exist today to detect the small density perturbations that low-mass dark matter subhaloes impart on stellar streams from disrupting Galactic satellites. In anticipation of these observations, we investigate the expected number and size of gaps by combining an analytic prescription for gap evolution on circular orbits with the flux of subhaloes near the stream. We explore the distribution of gap sizes and depths for a typical cold stream around the Milky Way and find that for a given stream age and gap depth, each subhalo mass produces a characteristic gap size. For a stream with an age of a few Gyr, orbiting at a distance of 10-20 kpc from the Galactic centre, even modest subhaloes with a mass of 10\textsuperscript{6}-10\textsuperscript{7} M\textsubscript{☉} produce gaps with sizes that are of the order of several degrees. We consider the number and distribution of gap sizes created by subhaloes with masses 10\textsuperscript{5}-10\textsuperscript{9} M\textsubscript{☉}, accounting for the expected depletion of subhaloes by the Milky Way disc, and present predictions for six cold streams around the Milky Way. For Pal 5, we forecast 0.7 gaps with a density depletion of at least 25 per cent and a typical gap size of 8°. Thus, there appears to be no tension between the recent non-detection of density depletions in the Pal 5 tidal tails and ΛCDM expectations. These predictions can be used to guide the scale of future gap searches.},

However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

  abstract = {The role of cosmic rays generated by supernovae and young stars has very recently begun to receive significant attention in studies of galaxy formation and evolution due to the realization that cosmic rays can efficiently accelerate galactic winds. Microscopic cosmic-ray transport processes are fundamental for determining the efficiency of cosmic-ray wind driving. Previous studies modeled cosmic-ray transport either via a constant diffusion coefficient or via streaming proportional to the Alfvén speed. However, in predominantly cold, neutral gas, cosmic rays can propagate faster than in the ionized medium, and the effective transport can be substantially larger; i.e., cosmic rays can decouple from the gas. We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of patches of galactic disks including the effects of cosmic rays. Our simulations include the decoupling of cosmic rays in the cold, neutral interstellar medium. We find that, compared to the ordinary diffusive cosmic-ray transport case, accounting for the decoupling leads to significantly different wind properties, such as the gas density and temperature, significantly broader spatial distribution of cosmic rays, and higher wind speed. These results have implications for X-ray, γ-ray, and radio emission, and for the magnetization and pollution of the circumgalactic medium by cosmic rays.},

  abstract = {We investigate how rotationally constrained, deep convection might give rise to supergranulation, the largest distinct spatial scale of convection observed in the solar photosphere. While supergranulation is only weakly influenced by rotation, larger spatial scales of convection sample the deep convection zone and are presumably rotationally influenced. We present numerical results from a series of nonlinear, 3D simulations of rotating convection and examine the velocity power distribution realized under a range of Rossby numbers. When rotation is present, the convective power distribution possesses a pronounced peak, at characteristic wavenumber \{\{\textbackslash ell \}\}\textsubscript{\{peak\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\}, whose value increases as the Rossby number is decreased. This distribution of power contrasts with that realized in non-rotating convection, where power increases monotonically from high to low wavenumbers. We find that spatial scales smaller than \{\{\textbackslash ell \}\}\textsubscript{\{peak\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\} behave in analogy to non-rotating convection. Spatial scales larger than \{\{\textbackslash ell \}\}\textsubscript{\{peak\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\} are rotationally constrained and possess substantially reduced power relative to the non-rotating system. We argue that the supergranular scale emerges due to a suppression of power on spatial scales larger than \{\textbackslash ell \}≈ 100 owing to the presence of deep, rotationally constrained convection. Supergranulation thus represents the largest non-rotationally constrained mode of solar convection. We conclude that the characteristic spatial scale of supergranulation bounds that of the deep convective motions from above, making supergranulation an indirect measure of the deep-seated dynamics at work in the solar dynamo. Using the spatial scale of supergranulation in conjunction with our numerical results, we estimate an upper bound of 10 m s\textsuperscript{-1} for the Sun’s bulk rms convective velocity.},

  abstract = {Based on two-dimensional numerical radiation hydrodynamics simulations of time-dependent compressible convection, we have studied the structure and dynamics of a variety of shallow stellar surface convection zones. Our present grid of models includes detailed simulations of surface convection in solar-type stars, main-sequence A-type stars and cool DA white dwarfs, as well as numerical experiments to study convection and overshoot at the base of the solar convection zone. Taking into account a realistic equation of state (including the effects of ionization) and adopting an elaborate treatment of non-local radiative transfer (with appropriate grey or frequency-dependent opacities), our simulations are designed to represent specific stellar objects characterized by T\_eff\_, logg, and chemical composition. Contrary to solar-type stars, the A-type stars and cool DA white dwarfs investigated here have shallow convection zones which fit into the computational domain together with thick stable buffer layers on top and below, thus permitting a study of convective overshoot under genuine conditions. We find that convective motions extend well beyond the boundary of the convectively unstable region, with vertical velocities decaying exponentially with depth in the deeper parts of the lower overshoot region, as expected for linear g\^-\^-modes. Even though convective velocities are reduced by orders of magnitude, they are still able to counteract molecular diffusion. For a quantitative description of convective mixing in the far overshoot layers we have derived a depth dependent diffusion coefficient from the numerical simulations. In combination with otherwise independent 1D diffusion calculations for a trace element, this allows the determination of the "effective depth" of the overshoot region. For a typical main-sequence A-type star (T\_eff\_=7943\#1, logg=4.34) the mass in the overshoot region exceeds the mass in the unstable region by approximately a factor 10. The amount of overshoot in cool DA white dwarfs (around T\_eff\_=12200\#1) is even larger: the convectively mixed mass is increased by roughly a factor 100.},

  abstract = {High-resolution images of the solar surface show a granulation pattern of hot rising and cooler downward-sinking material - the top of the deep-reaching solar convection zone. Convection plays a role for the thermal structure of the solar interior and the dynamo acting there, for the stratification of the photosphere, where most of the visible light is emitted, as well as for the energy budget of the spectacular processes in the chromosphere and corona. Convective stellar atmospheres can be modeled by numerically solving the coupled equations of (magneto)hydrodynamics and non-local radiation transport in the presence of a gravity field. The CO5BOLD code described in this article is designed for so-called "realistic" simulations that take into account the detailed microphysics under the conditions in solar or stellar surface layers (equation-of-state and optical properties of the matter). These simulations indeed deserve the label "realistic" because they reproduce the various observables very well - with only minor differences between different implementations. The agreement with observations has improved over time and the simulations are now well-established and have been performed for a number of stars. Still, severe challenges are encountered when it comes to extending these simulations to include ideally the entire star or substellar object: the strong stratification leads to completely different conditions in the interior, the photosphere, and the corona. Simulations have to cover spatial scales from the sub-granular level to the stellar diameter and time scales from photospheric wave travel times to stellar rotation or dynamo cycle periods. Various non-equilibrium processes have to be taken into account. Last but not least, realistic simulations are based on detailed microphysics and depend on the quality of the input data, which can be the actual accuracy limiter. This article provides an overview of the physical problem and the numerical solution and the capabilities of CO5BOLD, illustrated with a number of applications.},

Before central hydrogen is exhausted, and long before the major core helium flash occurs, the Z = 0 model experiences a helium-burning thermal runaway at the center. As this model evolves along the giant branch, recurrent helium-burning thermal runaways are initiated at the base of the hydrogen-burning shell. The thermal structure of the electron-degenerate core of the Z = 0 red giant is completely different from that of the higher Z red giants. As a result of this structure, the major flash begins at a location much farther from the center than in the higher Z cases. Most significantly, during the flash in the Z = 0 model, the outer edge of the convective shell formed in the helium zone extends into layer containing hydrogen, which does not occur in the Z = 0.0001 or Z = 0.02 cases.},

  abstract = {The exponential growing rate of the networking technologies has led to a dramatical large scope of the connected computing environment. Internet-of-Things (IoT) is considered an alternative for obtaining high performance by the enhanced capabilities in system controls, resource allocations, data exchanges, and flexible adoptions. However, current IoT is encountering the bottleneck of the resource allocation due to the mismatching networking service quality and complicated service offering environments. This paper concentrates on the issue of resource allocations in IoT and utilizes the satisfactory level of Quality of Experience (QoE) to achieve intelligent content-centric services. A novel approach is proposed by this work, which utilizes the mechanism of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to obtain high accurate QoE in resource allocations. Two RL-based algorithms have been proposed for cost mapping tables creations and optimal resource allocations. Our experiment evaluations have assessed the efficiency of implementing the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Dropout is used as a practical tool to obtain uncertainty estimates in large vision models and reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. But to obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, a grid-search over the dropout probabilities is necessary - a prohibitive operation with large models, and an impossible one with RL. We propose a new dropout variant which gives improved performance and better calibrated uncertainties. Relying on recent developments in Bayesian deep learning, we use a continuous relaxation of dropout's discrete masks. Together with a principled optimisation objective, this allows for automatic tuning of the dropout probability in large models, and as a result faster experimentation cycles. In RL this allows the agent to adapt its uncertainty dynamically as more data is observed. We analyse the proposed variant extensively on a range of tasks, and give insights into common practice in the field where larger dropout probabilities are often used in deeper model layers.},

  abstract = {One of the main challenges in Grid computing is efficient allocation of resources (CPU – hours, network bandwidth, etc.) to the tasks submitted by users. Due to the lack of centralized control and the dynamic/stochastic nature of resource availability, any successful allocation mechanism should be highly distributed and robust to the changes in the Grid environment. Moreover, it is desirable to have an allocation mechanism that does not rely on the availability of coherent global information. In this paper we examine a simple algorithm for distributed resource allocation in a simplified Grid-like environment that meets the above requirements. Our system consists of a large number of heterogenous reinforcement learning agents that share common resources for their computational needs. There is no explicit communication or interaction between the agents: the only information that agents receive is the expected response time of a job it submitted to a particular resource, which serves as a reinforcement signal for the agent. The results of our experiments suggest that even simple reinforcement learning can indeed be used to achieve load balanced resource allocation in large scale heterogenous system.},

The optimal allocation maximizes an average weighted sum-capacity subject to power limitation and data congestion constraints. Both adaptive power assignment and node selection are considered based on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of the links. By parameterizing the resource allocation policy, we formulate the problem as an unsupervised statistical learning problem. We consider the graph neural network (GNN) for the policy parameterization to exploit the FSO network structure with small-scale training parameters. The GNN is shown to retain the permutation equivariance that matches with the permutation equivariance of resource allocation policy in networks. The primal-dual learning algorithm is developed to train the GNN in a model-free manner, where the knowledge of system models is not required. Numerical simulations present the strong performance of the GNN relative to a baseline policy with equal power assignment and random node selection.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has triggered the current rise of artificial intelligence and is the workhorse of today’s machine intelligence. Numerous success stories have rapidly spread all over science, industry and society, but its limitations have only recently come into focus. In this Perspective we seek to distil how many of deep learning’s failures can be seen as different symptoms of the same underlying problem: shortcut learning. Shortcuts are decision rules that perform well on standard benchmarks but fail to transfer to more challenging testing conditions, such as real-world scenarios. Related issues are known in comparative psychology, education and linguistics, suggesting that shortcut learning may be a common characteristic of learning systems, biological and artificial alike. Based on these observations, we develop a set of recommendations for model interpretation and benchmarking, highlighting recent advances in machine learning to improve robustness and transferability from the lab to real-world applications.},

  abstract = {We used high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra obtained with the Very Large Telescope and the UV-Visual Echelle Spectrograph to determine abundances of 17 elements in four red giants in the Sculptor (Scl) dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Our [Fe/H]-values range from -2.10 to -0.97, confirming previous findings of a large metallicity spread. We combined our data with similar data for five Scl giants studied recently by Shetrone et al. to form one of the largest samples of high-resolution abundances yet obtained for a dwarf spheroidal galaxy, covering essentially the full known metallicity range in this galaxy. These properties allow us to establish trends of [X/Fe] with [Fe/H] for many elements X. The trends are significantly different from the trends seen in Galactic halo and globular cluster stars. This conclusion is evident for most of the elements from oxygen to manganese. We compare our Scl sample with the most similar Galactic counterparts and find substantial differences remain even with these stars. The many discrepancies in the relationships between [X/Fe] as seen in Scl compared with Galactic field stars indicate that our halo cannot be made up in bulk of stars similar to those presently seen in dwarf spheroidal galaxies like Scl, corroborating similar conclusions reached by Shetrone et al., Fulbright, and Tolstoy et al. These results have serious implications for the Searle-Zinn and hierarchical galaxy formation scenarios. We also find that the most metal-rich star in our sample is a heavy element-rich star. This star and the [Ba/Eu] trend we see indicate that asymptotic giant branch stars must have played an important role in the evolution of the s-process elements in Scl. A very high percentage of such heavy-element stars are now known in dwarf spheroidals compared with the halo, further mitigating against the formation of the halo from such objects.},

We introduce a simple modification for autoencoder neural networks that yields powerful generative models. Our method masks the autoencoder's parameters to respect autoregressive constraints: each input is reconstructed only from previous inputs in a given ordering. Constrained this way, the autoencoder outputs can be interpreted as a set of conditional probabilities, and their product, the full joint probability. We can also train a single network that can decompose the joint probability in multiple different orderings. Our simple framework can be applied to multiple architectures, including deep ones. Vectorized implementations, such as on GPUs, are simple and fast. Experiments demonstrate that this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art tractable distribution estimators. At test time, the method is significantly faster and scales better than other autoregressive estimators.},

Subjects who are faculty members or graduate students are asked to find the function from which a plot of ten coordinate values affected by random error was derived. Their protocols serve as the basis for an information processing computer model of performance on the task. The model has a perceptual phase in which a pattern is found in the data, the selection of a class of hypothesized functions, a problem solving phase to find a specific function, and the ability to recycle if necessary. This seems to be compatible with reports of hypothesis development and the small amount of empirical research in other contexts. Tests of the model reveal it does a good job of getting the same answers as subjects and can explain some, not most, of the process leading up to the answers. Due to the contrived nature of the task the model is most appropriate for understanding routine scientific inference.},

  abstract = {We introduce a novel machine-learning framework for estimating the Bayesian posteriors of morphological parameters for arbitrarily large numbers of galaxies. The Galaxy Morphology Posterior Estimation Network (GaMPEN) estimates values and uncertainties for a galaxy’s bulge-to-total-light ratio (L B /L T ), effective radius (R e ), and flux (F). To estimate posteriors, GaMPEN uses the Monte Carlo Dropout technique and incorporates the full covariance matrix between the output parameters in its loss function. GaMPEN also uses a spatial transformer network (STN) to automatically crop input galaxy frames to an optimal size before determining their morphology. This will allow it to be applied to new data without prior knowledge of galaxy size. Training and testing GaMPEN on galaxies simulated to match z {$<$} 0.25 galaxies in Hyper Suprime-Cam Wide g-band images, we demonstrate that GaMPEN achieves typical errors of 0.1 in L B /L T , 0.″17 (∼7\%) in R e , and 6.3 × 104 nJy (∼1\%) in F. GaMPEN's predicted uncertainties are well calibrated and accurate ({$<$}5\% deviation)—for regions of the parameter space with high residuals, GaMPEN correctly predicts correspondingly large uncertainties. We also demonstrate that we can apply categorical labels (i.e., classifications such as highly bulge dominated) to predictions in regions with high residuals and verify that those labels are ≳97\% accurate. To the best of our knowledge, GaMPEN is the first machine-learning framework for determining joint posterior distributions of multiple morphological parameters and is also the first application of an STN to optical imaging in astronomy.},

Chaotic systems thus pose a unique challenge to modern statistical learning techniques, while retaining quantifiable mathematical properties that make them controllable and interpretable as benchmarks. Here, we present a growing database currently comprising 131 known chaotic dynamical systems spanning fields such as astrophysics, climatology, and biochemistry. Each system is paired with precomputed multivariate and univariate time series. Our dataset has comparable scale to existing static time series databases; however, our systems can be re-integrated to produce additional datasets of arbitrary length and granularity. Our dataset is annotated with known mathematical properties of each system, and we perform feature analysis to broadly categorize the diverse dynamics present across the collection. Chaotic systems inherently challenge forecasting models, and across extensive benchmarks we correlate forecasting performance with the degree of chaos present. We also exploit the unique generative properties of our dataset in several proof-of-concept experiments: surrogate transfer learning to improve time series classification, importance sampling to accelerate model training, and benchmarking symbolic regression algorithms.},

Our GCN predicts functions more accurately than Convolutional Neural Networks trained on sequence data alone and competing methods. Feature extraction via a language model removes the need for constructing multiple sequence alignments or feature engineering. Our model learns general structure-function relationships by robustly predicting functions of proteins with ¡= 30\% sequence identity to the training set. Using class activation mapping, we can automatically identify structural regions at the residue-level that lead to each function prediction for every protein confidently predicted, advancing site-specific function prediction. De-noising inherent in the trained model allows an only minor drop in performance when structure predictions are used, including multiple de novo protocols. We use our method to annotate all proteins in the PDB, making several new confident function predictions spanning both fold and function trees.},

  abstract = {How does science work? Does it tell us what the world is "really" like? What makes it different from other ways of understanding the universe? In Theory and Reality, Peter Godfrey-Smith addresses these questions by taking the reader on a grand tour of one hundred years of debate about science. The result is a completely accessible introduction to the main themes of the philosophy of science.  Intended for undergraduates and general readers with no prior background in philosophy, Theory and Reality covers logical positivism; the problems of induction and confirmation; Karl Popper's theory of science; Thomas Kuhn and "scientific revolutions"; the views of Imre Lakatos, Larry Laudan, and Paul Feyerabend; and challenges to the field from sociology of science, feminism, and science studies. The book then looks in more detail at some specific problems and theories, including scientific realism, the theory-ladeness of observation, scientific explanation, and Bayesianism. Finally, Godfrey-Smith defends a form of philosophical naturalism as the best way to solve the main problems in the field.  Throughout the text he points out connections between philosophical debates and wider discussions about science in recent decades, such as the infamous "science wars." Examples and asides engage the beginning student; a glossary of terms explains key concepts; and suggestions for further reading are included at the end of each chapter. However, this is a textbook that doesn't feel like a textbook because it captures the historical drama of changes in how science has been conceived over the last one hundred years.  Like no other text in this field, Theory and Reality combines a survey of recent history of the philosophy of science with current key debates in language that any beginning scholar or critical reader can follow.},

Specifically, proportionate reproduction, ranking selection, tournament selection, and Genitor (or “steady state”) selection are compared on the basis of solutions to deterministic difference or differential equations, which are verified through computer simulations. The analysis provides convenient approximate or exact solutions as well as useful convergence time and growth ratio estimates. The paper recommends practical application of the analyses and suggests a number of paths for more detailed analytical investigation of selection techniques.},

The algorithm directly maximizes a stochastic variant of the leave-one-out KNN score on the training set. It can also learn a low-dimensional linear embedding of labeled data that can be used for data visualization and fast classification. Unlike other methods, our classification model is non-parametric, making no assumptions about the shape of the class distributions or the boundaries between them. The performance of the method is demonstrated on several data sets, both for metric learning and linear dimensionality reduction.},

Understanding this nonlinear system is complicated by the dynamical effects of velocity shear between fast and slow solar wind streams, by the spherical expansion of the solar wind, and by its compressibility. Direct spacecraft observations from 0.3 to over 20 AU, radio scintillation observations of plasmas near the Sun, numerical simulations, and various models provide complementary methods that have shown convincingly that the fluctuations in the wind parameters undergo significant dynamical evolution independent of whatever turbulence might exist in the solar photosphere and corona. This rich area of study allows one to test theories of turbulence against direct observation, and to use observations to guide and motivate development of turbulence theories. The solar wind thus provides an excellent laboratory for studying many fundamental questions about turbulent plasmas.},

  abstract = {An introduction to a broad range of topics in deep learning, covering mathematical and conceptual background, deep learning techniques used in industry, and research perspectives.“Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.”—Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceXDeep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.},

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

  abstract = {As mathematical computing becomes more democratized in high-level languages, high-performance symbolic-numeric systems are necessary for domain scientists and engineers to get the best performance out of their machine without deep knowledge of code optimization. Naturally, users need different term types either to have different algebraic properties for them, or to use efficient data structures. To this end, we developed Symbolics.jl, an extendable symbolic system which uses dynamic multiple dispatch to change behavior depending on the domain needs. In this work we detail an underlying abstract term interface which allows for speed without sacrificing generality. We show that by formalizing a generic API on actions independent of implementation, we can retroactively add optimized data structures to our system without changing the pre-existing term rewriters. We showcase how this can be used to optimize term construction and give a 113x acceleration on general symbolic transformations. Further, we show that such a generic API allows for complementary term-rewriting implementations. Exploiting this feature, we demonstrate the ability to swap between classical term-rewriting simplifiers and e-graph-based term-rewriting simplifiers. We illustrate how this symbolic system improves numerical computing tasks by showcasing an e-graph ruleset which minimizes the number of CPU cycles during expression evaluation, and demonstrate how it simplifies a real-world reaction-network simulation to halve the runtime. Additionally, we show a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation solver which is able to be automatically converted into symbolic expressions via multiple dispatch tracing, which is subsequently accelerated and parallelized to give a 157x simulation speedup. Together, this presents Symbolics.jl as a next-generation symbolic-numeric computing environment geared towards modeling and simulation.},

  abstract = {Artificial neural networks are remarkably adept at sensory processing, sequence learning and reinforcement learning, but are limited in their ability to represent variables and data structures and to store data over long timescales, owing to the lack of an external memory. Here we introduce a machine learning model called a differentiable neural computer (DNC), which consists of a neural network that can read from and write to an external memory matrix, analogous to the random-access memory in a conventional computer. Like a conventional computer, it can use its memory to represent and manipulate complex data structures, but, like a neural network, it can learn to do so from data. When trained with supervised learning, we demonstrate that a DNC can successfully answer synthetic questions designed to emulate reasoning and inference problems in natural language. We show that it can learn tasks such as finding the shortest path between specified points and inferring the missing links in randomly generated graphs, and then generalize these tasks to specific graphs such as transport networks and family trees. When trained with reinforcement learning, a DNC can complete a moving blocks puzzle in which changing goals are specified by sequences of symbols. Taken together, our results demonstrate that DNCs have the capacity to solve complex, structured tasks that are inaccessible to neural networks without external read–write memory.},

  abstract = {We present a new three-dimensional map of dust reddening, based on Gaia parallaxes and stellar photometry from Pan-STARRS 1 and 2MASS. This map covers the sky north of a declination of -30 degrees, out to a distance of several kiloparsecs. This new map contains three major improvements over our previous work. First, the inclusion of Gaia parallaxes dramatically improves distance estimates to nearby stars. Second, we incorporate a spatial prior that correlates the dust density across nearby sightlines. This produces a smoother map, with more isotropic clouds and smaller distance uncertainties, particularly to clouds within the nearest kiloparsec. Third, we infer the dust density with a distance resolution that is four times finer than in our previous work, to accommodate the improvements in signal-to-noise enabled by the other improvements. As part of this work, we infer the distances, reddenings and types of 799 million stars. We obtain typical reddening uncertainties that are \textbackslash textasciitilde30\% smaller than those reported in the Gaia DR2 catalog, reflecting the greater number of photometric passbands that enter into our analysis. Our 3D dust map can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/2EJ9TX or through the Python package "dustmaps," and can be queried interactively at http://argonaut.skymaps.info.

The visible portion of the stream does not pass near any known dwarf galaxies, although we cannot rule out that the stream may form the inner part of a known dwarf galaxy's orbit. The most likely explanation is that the stream constitutes the remains of a dwarf galaxy that has been completely disrupted at some point in the past.

The visible portion of the stream is very narrow and about 8.5 kpc above the Galactic disk, suggesting that the progenitor is or was a globular cluster. While the surface density of the stream varies considerably along its length, its path on the sky is very smooth and uniform, showing no evidence of perturbations by large mass concentrations in the nearby halo.

The fourth stream is much broader, roughly 45 kpc distant, at least 53° in length, and is most likely the tidal debris from a dwarf galaxy. As each of the streams spans multiple constellations, we extend tradition and designate them the Acheron, Cocytos, Lethe, and Styx streams. At the same distance and apparently embedded in the Styx stream is a \textasciitilde 1 kpc wide concentration of stars with an apparently similar color-magnitude distribution, which we designate Bootes III. Given its very low surface density, its location within the stream, and its apparently disturbed morphology, we argue that Bootes III may be the progenitor of Styx and in possibly the final throes of tidal dissolution. While the current data do not permit strong constraints, preliminary orbit estimates for the streams do not point to any likely progenitors among the known globular clusters and dwarf galaxies.},

The three-stream complex varies in width from 4° to 6° along its length and appears to be made up of two or more narrow substreams as well as a broader, diffuse component. The width and complexity of the stream indicate that the progenitor was likely a dwarf galaxy of significant size and mass. The stream is 8.9 kpc distant and is oriented almost perpendicularly to our line of sight. The visible portion of the stream does not pass near any known dwarf galaxies, and a preliminary orbit does not point to any viable progenitor candidates. Orbits for the narrower substreams can be modeled with velocity offsets from the broad component of \textasciitilde 8 km s-1. We suggest that the broad component is likely to be the remains of a dwarf galaxy, while the narrower streams constitute the remnants of dynamically distinct components that may have included a native population of globular clusters. While the color of the main-sequence turnoff is not unlike that for the Monoceros Ring, neither the visible stream nor any reasonable projection of its orbit passes through Monoceros or Canis Major, and we conclude that this stream is probably unrelated to the overdensities found in these regions.},

While Hermus passes within 1° (in projection) of the globular cluster NGC 6229, a roughly one magnitude difference in distance modulus, combined with no signs of connecting with NGC 6229's Roche lobe, argue against any physical association between the two.

We contribute extensive benchmarks of standard and novel deep learning methods as well as tree-based models such as XGBoost and Random Forests, across a large number of datasets and hyperparameter combinations. We define a standard set of 45 datasets from varied domains with clear characteristics of tabular data and a benchmarking methodology accounting for both fitting models and finding good hyperparameters. Results show that tree-based models remain state-of-the-art on medium-sized data (\$\textbackslash sim\$10K samples) even without accounting for their superior speed. To understand this gap, we conduct an empirical investigation into the differing inductive biases of tree-based models and Neural Networks (NNs). This leads to a series of challenges which should guide researchers aiming to build tabular-specific NNs: 1. be robust to uninformative features, 2. preserve the orientation of the data, and 3. be able to easily learn irregular functions. To stimulate research on tabular architectures, we contribute a standard benchmark and raw data for baselines: every point of a 20 000 compute hours hyperparameter search for each learner.},

  abstract = {A promising method for improving the representation of clouds in climate models, and hence climate projections, is to develop machine learning-based parameterizations using output from global storm-resolving models. While neural networks can achieve state-of-the-art performance, they are typically climate model-specific, require post-hoc tools for interpretation, and struggle to predict outside of their training distribution. To avoid these limitations, we combine symbolic regression, sequential feature selection, and physical constraints in a hierarchical modeling framework. This framework allows us to discover new equations diagnosing cloud cover from coarse-grained variables of global storm-resolving model simulations. These analytical equations are interpretable by construction and easily transferable to other grids or climate models. Our best equation balances performance and complexity, achieving a performance comparable to that of neural networks (\$R\^2=0.94\$) while remaining simple (with only 13 trainable parameters). It reproduces cloud cover distributions more accurately than the Xu-Randall scheme across all cloud regimes (Hellinger distances \${$<$}0.09\$), and matches neural networks in condensate-rich regimes. When applied and fine-tuned to the ERA5 reanalysis, the equation exhibits superior transferability to new data compared to all other optimal cloud cover schemes. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of symbolic regression in discovering interpretable, physically-consistent, and nonlinear equations to parameterize cloud cover.},

Here, we introduce a Bayesian machine scientist, which establishes the plausibility of models using explicit approximations to the exact marginal posterior over models and establishes its prior expectations about models by learning from a large empirical corpus of mathematical expressions. It explores the space of models using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We show that this approach uncovers accurate models for synthetic and real data and provides out-of-sample predictions that are more accurate than those of existing approaches and of other nonparametric methods.},

The recently proposed Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) makes progress toward stable training of GANs, but sometimes can still generate only low-quality samples or fail to converge. We find that these problems are often due to the use of weight clipping in WGAN to enforce a Lipschitz constraint on the critic, which can lead to undesired behavior. We propose an alternative to clipping weights: penalize the norm of gradient of the critic with respect to its input. Our proposed method performs better than standard WGAN and enables stable training of a wide variety of GAN architectures with almost no hyperparameter tuning, including 101-layer ResNets and language models over discrete data. We also achieve high quality generations on CIFAR-10 and LSUN bedrooms.},

Daily flow rate at present is being predicted based on different time-series scenarios. For this purpose, various LGP and NN models are calibrated with training sets and validated by testing sets. Additionally, the robustness of the proposed LGP and NN models are evaluated by application data, which are used neither in training nor at testing stage. The results showed that both techniques predicted the flow rate data in quite good agreement with the observed ones, and the predictions of LGP and NN are challenging. The performance of LGP, which was moderately better than NN, is very promising and hence supports the use of LGP in predicting of river flow data.},

  abstract = {Red giants are sometimes surrounded by envelopes, the result of the ejection of stellar matter at a large rate (dot M\&gt; 10\^\{-7\}M\_odot/yr) and at a low velocity (10 km/s). In this review the envelopes are discussed and the relation between stars and envelope: what stars combine with what envelopes? The envelope emits radiation by various processes and has been detected at all wavelengths between the visual and the microwave range. I review the observations of continuum radiation emitted by dust particles and of rotational transitions of molecules, where these molecules have been excited by thermal or by non thermal (“maser”) processes. I discuss mainly the oxygen rich stars, those of spectral type M, and only briefly the closely related carbon rich stars. By and large the density in the envelope is well described by spherically symmetric outflow at a constant velocity; on the time scale needed to flow from stellar surface to the outermost layers, i.e. 10\^5 yr, the loss of mass is sometimes interrupted suddenly after which the envelope becomes “detached” from the star. The temperature decreases when moving outward; heat input is by friction between dust particles and gas and cooling occurs by line radiation by various molecules, especially by H\_2O. The molecular composition is determined by formation in an equilibrium process deep in the atmosphere and by destruction in the outer parts of the outflow by interstellar UV radiation (H\_2, CO, H\_2O) or by depletion due to condensation on dust grains (SiO); dust particles of silicate material solidify where the radiation temperature is decreased to about 1000 K, and this is at a few stellar radii. The various continuum spectra produced by the dust particles in different stars are well modelled by a simple model of the density and dust temperature distribution plus the assumption that the particles consist of “dirty silicate”, i.e. silicate with Fe and Al ions added. A large range of optical depths,tau\_\{9.7μm\} , is observed: from 0.01 to 10. In envelopes with large optical depth the star itself can no longer be detected directly. Model calculations also show that the momentum in the outflow, i.e.dot M.v\_out is provided by radiation pressure on the dust particles followed by the complete transfer of this momentum to the gas. The mass loss rate itself,dot M , is not determined by radiation pressure but by dynamic processes in the region below the dust condensation layer. When tau\_\{9.7μm\} is sufficiently large its measurement, that of the stellar luminosity,L\_* and that of the outflow velocity,v\_out , permit the determination ofdot M , i.e. the total outflow rate, without making assumptions about the abundance of the dust particles or of the molecular gases. Detached envelopes have been seen in a few cases. Thermal molecular radiation is faint compared to the maser emission but has been measured in distant stars, e.g. in stars near the galactic center. Different molecules outline different “spheres” around the star. The largest sphere (a radius of 0.1 pc) is outlined by an emission line belonging to the CO(v=0, J=1to 0) transition. Higher rotational transitions of CO give smaller diameters. A comparison of CO (J=2to 1) and (J=1to 0) fluxes in stars with very thick envelopes leads to the conclusion that an abrupt decrease in the mass loss rate occurred some ten thousand years ago. Three molecules produce each several maser lines: SiO, H\_2O and OH. Several new H\_2O lines have recently been discovered; their exploration has hardly been started. The high intensity of the maser lines makes interferometry possible and hence detailed mapping. The SiO lines are formed deep in the envelope, below the dust condensation layer. OH maser lines are produced farthest out, H\_2O lines in between. The excitation mechanisms for most maser lines is understood globally, but detailed models are lacking, largely because the problem is non linear and the solution of the radiative transfer equation requires a highly anisotropic geometry. The geometrical and kinematical properties of the 1612 MHz OH maser, which in many objects is very strong, are explained by a thin shell of OH; because the angular diameter of the shell can be measured directly and the linear diameter can be determined from the difference in the time of maximum flux of blue and red maser peaks, the distance of the shell and of the star can be measured. The presence or absence of individual maser lines appears to depend on the value oftau\_\{9.7μm\} and is well described by a sequence called “Lewis' chronology”. The central star is a long period variable with a period of 300 days or longer and with a large luminosity amplitude (∆ m\_bol\&gt; 0.7\^m). Evidence is given that each star has the maximum luminosity it will reach during its evolution and that it is a thermally pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch star (TP AGB) with a main sequence mass between 1 and 6M\_odot . Stars of the same main sequence mass,M\_ms , have different mass loss rates, in some cases by a factor of 10. The mass loss rate probably increases with time, and the highest mass loss rates are reached toward the end of the evolution. Stars with higherM\_ms ultimately reach higher mass loss rates. The calibration of the main sequence mass is reviewed. Most Mira variables with mass loss have a mass between 1.0 and 1.2M\_odot . OH/IR stars with periods over 1000 days have no counterparts among the carbon stars and thus have M\_ms\&gt; 4.5M\_odot. Stars as discussed in this review have been found only in the thin galactic disk and in the bulge. Finally I review several recently proposed scenarios for TP AGB evolution in which mass loss is taken into account. These scenarios represent the observations quite well; their major short coming is the lack of an explanation why the central stars are always large amplitude, long period variables and why such stars are the ones with high mass loss rates.},

  abstract = {Training neural networks is traditionally done by providing a sequence of random mini-batches sampled uniformly from the entire training data. In this work, we analyze the effect of curriculum learning, which involves the non-uniform sampling of mini-batches, on the training of deep networks, and specifically CNNs trained for image recognition. To employ curriculum learning, the training algorithm must resolve 2 problems: (i) sort the training examples by difficulty; (ii) compute a series of mini-batches that exhibit an increasing level of difficulty. We address challenge (i) using two methods: transfer learning from some competitive “teacher" network, and bootstrapping. In our empirical evaluation, both methods show similar benefits in terms of increased learning speed and improved final performance on test data. We address challenge (ii) by investigating different pacing functions to guide the sampling. The empirical investigation includes a variety of network architectures, using images from CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and subsets of ImageNet. We conclude with a novel theoretical analysis of curriculum learning, where we show how it effectively modifies the optimization landscape. We then define the concept of an ideal curriculum, and show that under mild conditions it does not change the corresponding global minimum of the optimization function.},

In this study, we propose AgentNet, a model-free data-driven framework consisting of deep neural networks to reveal and analyze the hidden interactions in complex systems from observed data alone. AgentNet utilizes a graph attention network with novel variable-wise attention to model the interaction between individual agents, and employs various encoders and decoders that can be selectively applied to any desired system. Our model successfully captured a wide variety of simulated complex systems, namely cellular automata (discrete), the Vicsek model (continuous), and active Ornstein--Uhlenbeck particles (non-Markovian) in which, notably, AgentNet's visualized attention values coincided with the true interaction strength and exhibited collective behavior that was absent in the training data. A demonstration with empirical data from a flock of birds showed that AgentNet could identify hidden interaction ranges exhibited by real birds, which cannot be detected by conventional velocity correlation analysis. We expect our framework to open a novel path to investigating complex systems and to provide insight into general process-driven modeling.},

  abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

  abstract = {A wealth of cosmological and astrophysical information is expected from many ongoing and upcoming large-scale surveys. It is crucial to prepare for these surveys now and develop tools that can efficiently extract most information. We present HIFlow: a fast generative model of the neutral hydrogen (HI) maps that is conditioned only on cosmology (\$\textbackslash Omega\_\{m\}\$ and \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{8\}\$) and designed using a class of normalizing flow models, the Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF). HIFlow is trained on the state-of-the-art simulations from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project. HIFlow has the ability to generate realistic diverse maps without explicitly incorporating the expected 2D maps structure into the flow as an inductive bias. We find that HIFlow is able to reproduce the CAMELS average and standard deviation HI power spectrum (Pk) within a factor of \$\textbackslash lesssim\$ 2, scoring a very high \$R\^\{2\} {$>$} 90\textbackslash\%\$. By inverting the flow, HIFlow provides a tractable high-dimensional likelihood for efficient parameter inference. We show that the conditional HIFlow on cosmology is successfully able to marginalize over astrophysics at the field level, regardless of the stellar and AGN feedback strengths. This new tool represents a first step toward a more powerful parameter inference, maximizing the scientific return of future HI surveys, and opening a new avenue to minimize the loss of complex information due to data compression down to summary statistics.},

  abstract = {We have obtained moderate resolution (R=few thousand) spectra of the Na I λλ5890, 5896 (Na D) absorption line in a sample of 32 far-IR-bright starburst galaxies. In 18 cases, the Na D line in the nucleus is produced primarily by interstellar gas, while cool stars contribute significantly in the others. In 12 of the 18 ``interstellar-dominated'' cases the Na D line is blueshifted by over 100 km s\textsuperscript{-1} relative to the galaxy systemic velocity (the ``outflow sources''), while no case shows a net redshift of more than 100 km s\textsuperscript{-1}. The absorption-line profiles in these outflow sources span the range from near the galaxy systemic velocity to a maximum blueshift of \textasciitilde 400-600 km s\textsuperscript{-1}. The outflow sources are galaxies systematically viewed more nearly face-on than the others. We therefore argue that the absorbing material consists of ambient interstellar material that has been entrained and accelerated along the minor axis of the galaxy by a hot starburst-driven superwind. The Na D lines are optically thick, but indirect arguments imply total hydrogen column densities of N\textsubscript{H}\textasciitilde few×10\textsuperscript{21} cm\textsuperscript{-2}. This implies that the superwind is expelling matter at a rate comparable to the star formation rate. This outflowing material is evidently very dusty: we find a strong correlation between the depth of the Na D profile and the line-of-sight reddening. Typical implied values are E(B-V)=0.3-1 over regions several-to-10 kpc in size. We briefly consider some of the potential implications of these observations. The estimated terminal velocities of superwinds inferred from the present data and extant X-ray data are typically 400-800 km\textsuperscript{-1}, are independent of the galaxy rotation speed, and are comparable to (substantially exceed) the escape velocities for L\textsubscript{*} (dwarf) galaxies. The resulting selective loss of metals from shallower potential wells can establish the mass-metallicity relation in spheroids, produce the observed metallicity in the intracluster medium, and enrich a general IGM to of order 10\textsuperscript{-1} solar metallicity. If the outflowing dust grains can survive their journey into the IGM, their effect on observations of cosmologically distant objects would be significant.},

  abstract = {Matter evolved under the influence of gravity from minuscule density fluctuations. Nonperturbative structure formed hierarchically over all scales and developed non-Gaussian features in the Universe, known as the cosmic web. To fully understand the structure formation of the Universe is one of the holy grails of modern astrophysics. Astrophysicists survey large volumes of the Universe and use a large ensemble of computer simulations to compare with the observed data to extract the full information of our own Universe. However, to evolve billions of particles over billions of years, even with the simplest physics, is a daunting task. We build a deep neural network, the Deep Density Displacement Model (D3M), which learns from a set of prerun numerical simulations, to predict the nonlinear large-scale structure of the Universe with the Zel’dovich Approximation (ZA), an analytical approximation based on perturbation theory, as the input. Our extensive analysis demonstrates that D3M outperforms the second-order perturbation theory (2LPT), the commonly used fast-approximate simulation method, in predicting cosmic structure in the nonlinear regime. We also show that D3M is able to accurately extrapolate far beyond its training data and predict structure formation for significantly different cosmological parameters. Our study proves that deep learning is a practical and accurate alternative to approximate 3D simulations of the gravitational structure formation of the Universe.},

  abstract = {A helium flash is a very brief thermal runaway nuclear fusion of large quantities of helium into carbon through the triple-alpha process in the core of low mass stars (between 0.8 solar masses (M☉) and 2.0 M☉) during their red giant phase (the Sun is predicted to experience a flash 1.2 billion years after it leaves the main sequence). A much rarer runaway helium fusion process can also occur on the surface of accreting white dwarf stars. Low mass stars do not produce enough gravitational pressure to initiate normal helium fusion. As the hydrogen in the core is exhausted, some of the helium left behind is instead compacted into degenerate matter, supported against gravitational collapse by quantum mechanical pressure rather than thermal pressure. This increases the density and temperature of the core until it reaches approximately 100 million kelvin, which is hot enough to cause helium fusion (or "helium burning") in the core. However, a fundamental quality of degenerate matter is that changes in temperature do not produce a change of volume of the matter until the thermal pressure becomes so very high that it exceeds degeneracy pressure. In main sequence stars, thermal expansion regulates the core temperature, but in degenerate cores this does not occur. Helium fusion increases the temperature, which increases the fusion rate, which further increases the temperature in a runaway reaction. This produces a flash of very intense helium fusion that lasts only a few minutes, but briefly emits energy at a rate comparable to the entire Milky Way galaxy. In the case of normal low mass stars, the vast energy release causes much of the core to come out of degeneracy, allowing it to thermally expand, however, consuming as much energy as the total energy released by the helium flash, and any left-over energy is absorbed into the star's upper layers. Thus the helium flash is mostly undetectable to observation, and is described solely by astrophysical models. After the core's expansion and cooling, the star's surface rapidly cools and contracts in as little as 10,000 years until it is roughly 2\% of its former radius and luminosity. It is estimated that the electron-degenerate helium core weighs about 40\% of the star mass and that 6\% of the core is converted into carbon.},

  abstract = {The evolution of intermediate-mass stars at very low metallicity during their final thermal pulse asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase is studied in detail. As representative examples, models with initial masses of 4 and 5M\textsubscript{solar} and with a metallicity of Z=0.0001 ([Fe/H]\textasciitilde -2.3) are discussed. The one-dimensional stellar structure and evolution model includes time- and depth-dependent overshooting motivated by hydrodynamic simulations, as well as a full nuclear network and time-dependent mixing. Particular attention is given to high time and space resolution to avoid numerical artifacts related to third dredge-up and hot bottom burning predictions. The model calculations predict very efficient third dredge-up that mixes the envelope with the entire intershell layer or a large fraction thereof and in some cases penetrates into the C/O core below the He shell. In all cases primary oxygen is mixed into the envelope. The models predict efficient envelope burning during the interpulse phase. Depending on the envelope-burning temperature, oxygen is destroyed to varying degrees. The combined effect of dredge-up and envelope burning does not lead to any significant oxygen depletion in any of the cases considered in this study. The large dredge-up efficiency in our model is closely related to the particular properties of the H shell during the dredge-up phase in low-metallicity very metal-poor stars, which is followed here over many thermal pulses. During the dredge-up phase, the temperature just below the convective boundary is large enough for protons to burn vigorously when they are brought into the C-rich environment below the convection boundary by the time- and depth-dependent overshooting. H-burning luminosities of 10\textsuperscript{5} to \textasciitilde 2×10\textsuperscript{6}L\textsubscript{solar} are generated. C, and to lesser degree O, is transformed into N in this dredge-up overshooting layer and enters the envelope. The global effect on the CNO abundance is similar to that of hot bottom burning. If the overshoot efficiency is larger, then dredge-up H burning causes a further increase in the dredge-up efficiency. After some thermal pulses, the dredge-up proceeds through the He shell and into the CO core beneath. Then neutrons may not be released from \textsuperscript{13}C in radiative conditions during the interpulse phase because of the scarcity of α-particles for the \textsuperscript{13}C(α,n)\textsuperscript{16}O reactions. Conditions for the s-process are discussed qualitatively. The abundance evolution of H, He, C, N, O, and Na is described. Finally, the model predictions for sodium and oxygen are compared with observed abundances. The notion that massive AGB stars are the origin of the O-Na abundance anticorrelation in globular cluster giants is not consistent with the model predictions of this study. The abundance of the C-rich extremely metal-poor binaries LP 625-44, CS 29497-030, and HE 0024-2523 is discussed.},

  abstract = {The influence of extended convective mixing (overshoot) on asymptotic giant branch stellar evolution is investigated in detail. The extended mixing is treated time-dependently, and the efficiency declines exponentially with the geometric distance from the convective boundary. It has been considered at all convective boundaries, including the He-flash convection zone in the intershell region which forms during the thermal pulses. Both the structural and the chemical evolution are affected by the inclusion of overshoot. The main results include a very efficient third dredge-up which leads to the formation of carbon stars of low mass and luminosity. A \textsuperscript{13}C pocket which may serve as a neutron source for the s-process can form after the third dredge-up has reached into the \textsuperscript{12}C rich intershell. Overshoot applied to the pulse-driven convective zone during the He-flash leads to a deeper penetration of the bottom of this convective zone into the C/O core below the He-burning shell. This in turn causes \textsuperscript{4}He to be less abundant in the intershell while \textsuperscript{12}C and \textsuperscript{16}O are more abundant compared to calculations without overshoot. We show that overshoot at the He-flash convection zone as well as at the base of the envelope convection enhance the efficiency of the third dredge-up.

Observations of the transient nature and anomalous abundance features are available to validate our method and assumptions, with the aim of applying them to very low-metallicity stars in the future. We include nuclear energy feedback from H burning and cover the full 4π geometry of the shell. Runs on 768\textsuperscript{3} and 1536\textsuperscript{3} grids agree well with each other and have been followed for 1500 minutes and 1200 minutes. After an 850 minute long quiescent entrainment phase, the simulations enter into a global non-spherical oscillation that is launched and sustained by individual ignition events of H-rich fluid pockets. Fast circumferential flows collide at the antipode and cause the formation and localized ignition of the next H-overabundant pocket. The cycle repeats for more than a dozen times while its amplitude decreases. During the global oscillation, the entrainment rate increases temporarily by a factor of ≈100. Entrained entropy quenches convective motions in the upper layer until the burning of entrained H establishes a separate convection zone. The lower-resolution run hints at the possibility that another global oscillation, perhaps even more violent, will follow. The location of the H-burning convection zone agrees with a one-dimensional model in which the mixing efficiency is calibrated to reproduce the light curve. The simulations have been performed at the NSF Blue Waters supercomputer at NCSA.},

We investigate the properties of shell convection immediately before the He luminosity peak during the 15th thermal pulse of a stellar evolution track with initially 2 solar masses and metallicity Z=0.01. This choice is a representative example of a low-mass asymptotic giant branch thermal pulse. We construct the initial vertical stratification with a set of polytropes to resemble the stellar evolution structure. Convection is driven by a constant volume heating in a thin layer at the bottom of the unstable layer. We calculate a grid of two-dimensional simulations with different resolutions and heating rates, plus one low-resolution three-dimensional run. The flow field is dominated by large convective cells that are centered in the lower half of the convection zone. It generates a rich spectrum of gravity waves in the stable layers both above and beneath the convective shell. The magnitude of the convective velocities from our one-dimensional mixing-length theory model and the rms-averaged vertical velocities from the hydrodynamic model are consistent within a factor of a few. However, the velocity profile in the hydrodynamic simulation is more asymmetric and decays exponentially inside the convection zone. Both g-modes and convective motions cross the formal convective boundaries, which leads to mixing across the boundaries. Our resolution study shows consistent flow structures among the higher resolution runs, and we see indications for convergence of the vertical velocity profile inside the convection zone for the highest resolution simulations. Many of the convective properties, in particular the exponential decay of the velocities, depend only weakly on the heating rate. However, the amplitudes of the gravity waves increase with both the heating rate and the resolution.},

  abstract = {When we perform probabilistic inferences with the Gaia Mission data, we technically require a likelihood function, or a probability of the (raw-ish) data as a function of stellar (astrometric and photometric) properties. Unfortunately, we aren't (at present) given access to the Gaia data directly; we are only given a Catalog of derived astrometric properties for the stars. How do we perform probabilistic inferences in this context? The answer - implicit in many publications - is that we should look at the Gaia Catalog as containing the parameters of a likelihood function, or a probability of the Gaia data, conditioned on stellar properties, evaluated at the location of the data. Concretely, my recommendation is to assume (for, say, the parallax) that the Catalog-reported value and uncertainty are the mean and root-variance of a Gaussian function that can stand in for the true likelihood function. This is the implicit assumption in most Gaia literature to date; my only goal here is to make the assumption explicit. Certain technical choices by the Mission team slightly invalidate this assumption for DR1 (TGAS), but not seriously. Generalizing beyond Gaia, it is important to downstream users of any Catalog products that they deliver likelihood information about the fundamental data; this is a challenge for the probabilistic catalogs of the future.},

This historical treatment is odd given that hardware and software have frequently determined which research ideas succeed (and fail). This essay introduces the term hardware lottery to describe when a research idea wins because it is suited to the available software and hardware and not because the idea is superior to alternative research directions. Examples from early computer science history illustrate how hardware lotteries can delay research progress by casting successful ideas as failures. These lessons are particularly salient given the advent of domain specialized hardware which make it increasingly costly to stray off of the beaten path of research ideas. This essay posits that the gains from progress in computing are likely to become even more uneven, with certain research directions moving into the fast-lane while progress on others is further obstructed.},

Previous FIRE simulations used an identical source code (`FIRE-1') for consistency. Motivated by the development of more accurate numerics - including hydrodynamic solvers, gravitational softening, and supernova coupling algorithms - and exploration of new physics (e.g. magnetic fields), we introduce `FIRE-2', an updated numerical implementation of FIRE physics for the GIZMO code. We run a suite of simulations and compare against FIRE-1: overall, FIRE-2 improvements do not qualitatively change galaxy-scale properties. We pursue an extensive study of numerics versus physics. Details of the star formation algorithm, cooling physics, and chemistry have weak effects provided that we include metal-line cooling and star formation occurs at higher-than-mean densities. We present new resolution criteria for high-resolution galaxy simulations. Most galaxy-scale properties are robust to numerics we test, provided: (1) Toomre masses are resolved; (2) feedback coupling ensures conservation, and (3) individual supernovae are time-resolved. Stellar masses and profiles are most robust to resolution, followed by metal abundances and morphologies, followed by properties of winds and circum-galactic media. Central (̃kpc) mass concentrations in massive (\&gt;L\textsubscript{*}) galaxies are sensitive to numerics (via trapping/recycling of winds in hot haloes). Multiple feedback mechanisms play key roles: supernovae regulate stellar masses/winds; stellar mass-loss fuels late star formation; radiative feedback suppresses accretion on to dwarfs and instantaneous star formation in discs. We provide all initial conditions and numerical algorithms used.},

But trees derived with traditional methods often cannot be grown to arbitrary complexity for possible loss of generalization accuracy on unseen data. The limitation on complexity usually means suboptimal accuracy on training data. Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a method to construct tree-based classifiers whose capacity can be arbitrarily expanded for increases in accuracy for both training and unseen data. The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in, different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved. The validity of the method is demonstrated through experiments on the recognition of handwritten digits.},

  abstract = {To reduce the problem of premature convergence we define a new method for measuring an individual's age and propose the Age-Layered Population Structure (ALPS). This new measure of age measures how long the genetic material has been evolving in the population: offspring start with an age of 1 plus the age of their oldest parent instead of starting with an age of 0 as with traditional measures of age. ALPS differs from a typical evolutionary algorithm (EA) by segregating individuals into different age-layers by their age and by regularly introducing new, randomly generated individuals in the youngest layer. The introduction of randomly generated individuals at regular intervals results in an EA that is never completely converged and is always exploring new parts of the fitness landscape. By using age to restrict competition and breeding, younger individuals are able to develop without being dominated by older ones. Analysis of the search behavior of ALPS finds that the offspring of individuals that are randomly generated mid-way through a run are able to move the population out of mediocre local-optima to better parts of the fitness landscape. In comparison against a traditional EA, a multi-start EA and two other EAs with diversity maintenance schemes we find that ALPS produces significantly better designs with a higher reliability than the other EAs.},

  abstract = {Gaussian multiplicative noise is commonly used as a stochastic regularisation technique in training of deterministic neural networks. A recent paper reinterpreted the technique as a specific algorithm for approximate inference in Bayesian neural networks; several extensions ensued. We show that the log-uniform prior used in all the above publications does not generally induce a proper posterior, and thus Bayesian inference in such models is ill-posed. Independent of the log-uniform prior, the correlated weight noise approximation has further issues leading to either infinite objective or high risk of overfitting. The above implies that the reported sparsity of obtained solutions cannot be explained by Bayesian or the related minimum description length arguments. We thus study the objective from a non-Bayesian perspective, provide its previously unknown analytical form which allows exact gradient evaluation, and show that the later proposed additive reparametrisation introduces minima not present in the original multiplicative parametrisation. Implications and future research directions are discussed.},

  abstract = {We present a comparison of parallaxes and radii from asteroseismology and Gaia DR1 (TGAS) for 2200 Kepler stars spanning from the main sequence to the red-giant branch. We show that previously identified offsets between TGAS parallaxes and distances derived from asteroseismology and eclipsing binaries have likely been overestimated for parallaxes ≲ 5\{--\}10 mas (≈90\%-98\% of the TGAS sample). The observed differences in our sample can furthermore be partially compensated by adopting a hotter \{T\}\textsubscript{\{eff\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\} scale (such as the infrared flux method) instead of spectroscopic temperatures for dwarfs and subgiants. Residual systematic differences are at the ≈2\% level in parallax across three orders of magnitude. We use TGAS parallaxes to empirically demonstrate that asteroseismic radii are accurate to ≈5\% or better for stars between ≈ 0.8\{--\}8 \{R\}\textsubscript{☉ }. We find no significant offset for main-sequence (≲ 1.5 \{R\}\textsubscript{☉ }) and low-luminosity RGB stars (≈3-8 \{R\}\textsubscript{☉ }), but seismic radii appear to be systematically underestimated by ≈5\% for subgiants (≈1.5-3 \{R\}\textsubscript{☉ }). We find no systematic errors as a function of metallicity between [\{Fe\}/\{\{H\}\}]≈ -0.8 to +0.4 dex, and show tentative evidence that corrections to the scaling relation for the large frequency separation (\{\{∆ \}\}ν ) improve the agreement with TGAS for RGB stars. Finally, we demonstrate that beyond ≈ 3 \{kpc\} asteroseismology will provide more precise distances than end-of-mission Gaia data, highlighting the synergy and complementary nature of Gaia and asteroseismology for studying galactic stellar populations.},

This family of methods consisting of several processing steps such as image registration, resampling, deconvolution, and artifact removal is used to combine images into a single higher-quality image. An alternative to these methods that are built upon vectorized operations is the representation of an image function as a neural network, which has had considerable success in machine learning image processing applications. We propose a deep learning method employing gradient-based planar alignment with Bundle-Adjusting Radiance Fields (BARF) to combine, de-noise, and remove obstructions from observations of cosmological objects at different resolutions, seeing, and noise levels – tasks not currently possible within a single process in astronomy. We test our algorithm on artificial images of star clusters, demonstrating powerful artifact removal and de-noising.},

  abstract = {Batteryless Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices need to schedule tasks on very limited energy budgets from intermittent energy harvesting. Creating an energy-aware scheduler allows the device to schedule tasks in an efficient manner to avoid power loss during execution. To achieve this, we need insight in the Worst-Case Energy Consumption (WCEC) of each schedulable task on the device. Different methodologies exist to determine or approximate the energy consumption. However, these approaches are computationally expensive and infeasible to perform on all type of devices; or are not accurate enough to acquire safe upper bounds. We propose a hybrid methodology that combines machine learning-based prediction on small code sections, called hybrid blocks, with static analysis to combine the predictions to a final upper bound estimation for the WCEC. In this paper, we present our work on an automated testbench for the Code Behaviour Framework (COBRA) that measures and profiles the upper bound energy consumption on the target device. Next, we use the upper bound measurements of the testbench to train eight different regression models that need to predict these upper bounds. The results show promising estimates for three regression models that could potentially be used for the methodology with additional tuning and training.},

Located in the constellation of Sagittarius, and on the far side of the Galactic Centre, it has not previously been seen because of the large number of foreground stars (in the Milky Way) in that direction. Following convention, we propose to call it the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Its properties are similar to those of the eight other dwarf spheroidal companions to the Milky Way, and it is comparable in size and luminosity to the largest of them- the Fornax system. The Sagittarius dwarf is elongated towards the plane of the Milky Way, suggesting that it is undergoing some tidal disruption before being absorbed by the Milky Way.},

We find that the system orbits close to the Galactic plane at Galactocentric distances between 4.9 kpc and 19.8 kpc. The discovery of this extended and extremely low surface brightness stream (Σ G ∼ 34.3 mag arcsec‑2), with a mass of only 2580 ± 140 M ⊙, demonstrates the power of the STREAMFINDER algorithm to detect even very nearby and ultra-faint structures.

Consequently, it is desirable to update available opacity databases with recent improvements in physics, refinements of element abundance, and other such factors affecting the results. Updated OPAL Rosseland mean opacities are presented. The new results have incorporated improvements in the physics and numerical procedures as well as corrections. The main opacity changes are increases of as much as 20\% for Population I stars due to the explicit inclusion of 19 metals (compared to 12 metals in the earlier calculations) with the other modifications introducing opacity changes smaller than 10\%. In addition, the temperature and density range covered by the updated opacity tables has been extended. As before, the tables allow accurate interpolation in density and temperature as well as hydrogen, helium, carbon, oxygen, and metal mass fractions. Although a specific metal composition is emphasized, opacity tables for different metal distributions can be made readily available. The updated opacities are compared to other work.},

Solutions indicate that a typical galaxy can lose mass at a rate of about 1 to 10 million solar masses per year and energy at a rate of about 10 to the 40th to 10 to the 42nd ergs per sec. The possible role of galactic winds in radio and X-ray sources is explored. A model is proposed to explain the X-ray emission observed from clusters of galaxies.},

Graph-based indexes are known to reduce the query time for high-dimensional data. To further improve the query time by using graphs, we focused on the indegrees and outdegrees of graphs. While a sufficient number of incoming edges (indegrees) are indispensable for increasing search accuracy, an excessive number of outgoing edges (outdegrees) should be suppressed so as to not increase the query time. Therefore, we propose three degree-adjustment methods: static degree adjustment of not only outdegrees but also indegrees, dynamic degree adjustment with which outdegrees are determined by the search accuracy users require, and path adjustment to remove edges that have alternative search paths to reduce outdegrees. We also show how to obtain optimal degree-adjustment parameters and that our methods outperformed previous methods for image and textual data.},

  abstract = {Galactic winds regulate star formation in disk galaxies and help to enrich the circum-galactic medium. They are therefore crucial for galaxy formation, but their driving mechanism is still poorly understood. Recent studies have demonstrated that cosmic rays (CRs) can drive outflows if active CR transport is taken into account. Using hydrodynamical simulations of isolated galaxies with virial masses between \$10\^\{10\}\$ and \$10\^\{13\}\textbackslash mathrm\{\textasciitilde M\_\textbackslash odot\}\$, we study how the properties of CR-driven winds depend on halo mass. CRs are treated in a two-fluid approximation and their transport is modelled through isotropic or anisotropic diffusion. We find that CRs are only able to drive mass-loaded winds beyond the virial radius in haloes with masses below \$10\^\{12\}\textbackslash mathrm\{\textasciitilde M\_\textbackslash odot\}\$. For our lowest examined halo mass, the wind is roughly spherical and has velocities of \$\textbackslash sim20\textbackslash mathrm\{\textasciitilde km\textbackslash;s\^\{-1\}\}\$. With increasing halo mass, the wind becomes biconical and can reach ten times higher velocities. The mass loading factor drops rapidly with virial mass, a dependence that approximately follows a power-law with a slope between \$-1\$ and \$-2\$. This scaling is slightly steeper than observational inferences, and also steeper than commonly used prescriptions for wind feedback in cosmological simulations. The slope is quite robust to variations of the CR injection efficiency or the CR diffusion coefficient. In contrast to the mass loading, the energy loading shows no significant dependence on halo mass. While these scalings are close to successful heuristic models of wind feedback, the CR-driven winds in our present models are not yet powerful enough to fully account for the required feedback strength.},

  abstract = {We aim to perform unsupervised discovery of objects and their states such as location and velocity, as well as physical system parameters such as mass and gravity from video -- given only the differential equations governing the scene dynamics. Existing physical scene understanding methods require either object state supervision, or do not integrate with differentiable physics to learn interpretable system parameters and states. We address this problem through a \$\textbackslash textit\{physics-as-inverse-graphics\}\$ approach that brings together vision-as-inverse-graphics and differentiable physics engines. This framework allows us to perform long term extrapolative video prediction, as well as vision-based model-predictive control. Our approach significantly outperforms related unsupervised methods in long-term future frame prediction of systems with interacting objects (such as ball-spring or 3-body gravitational systems). We further show the value of this tight vision-physics integration by demonstrating data-efficient learning of vision-actuated model-based control for a pendulum system. The controller's interpretability also provides unique capabilities in goal-driven control and physical reasoning for zero-data adaptation.},

  abstract = {Efficiently mapping baryonic properties onto dark matter is a major challenge in astrophysics. Although semianalytic models (SAMs) and hydrodynamical simulations have made impressive advances in reproducing galaxy observables across cosmologically significant volumes, these methods still require significant computation times, representing a barrier to many applications. Graph neural networks have recently proven to be the natural choice for learning physical relations. Among the most inherently graph-like structures found in astrophysics are the dark matter merger trees that encode the evolution of dark matter halos. In this paper, we introduce a new, graph-based emulator framework, Mangrove, and show that it emulates the galactic stellar mass, cold gas mass and metallicity, instantaneous and time-averaged star formation rate, and black hole mass—as predicted by an SAM—with an rms error up to 2 times lower than other methods across a (75 Mpc/h)3 simulation box in 40 s, 4 orders of magnitude faster than the SAM. We show that Mangrove allows for quantification of the dependence of galaxy properties on merger history. We compare our results to the current state of the art in the field and show significant improvements for all target properties.

  abstract = {Interpretability is crucial for machine learning in many scenarios such as quantitative finance, banking, healthcare, etc. Symbolic regression (SR) is a classic interpretable machine learning method by bridging X and Y using mathematical expressions composed of some basic functions. However, the search space of all possible expressions grows exponentially with the length of the expression, making it infeasible for enumeration. Genetic programming (GP) has been traditionally and commonly used in SR to search for the optimal solution, but it suffers from several limitations, e.g. the difficulty in incorporating prior knowledge; overly-complicated output expression and reduced interpretability etc. To address these issues, we propose a new method to fit SR under a Bayesian framework. Firstly, Bayesian model can naturally incorporate prior knowledge (e.g., preference of basis functions, operators and raw features) to improve the efficiency of fitting SR. Secondly, to improve interpretability of expressions in SR, we aim to capture concise but informative signals. To this end, we assume the expected signal has an additive structure, i.e., a linear combination of several concise expressions, whose complexity is controlled by a well-designed prior distribution. In our setup, each expression is characterized by a symbolic tree, and the proposed SR model could be solved by sampling symbolic trees from the posterior distribution using an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Finally, compared with GP, the proposed BSR(Bayesian Symbolic Regression) method saves computer memory with no need to keep an updated 'genome pool'. Numerical experiments show that, compared with GP, the solutions of BSR are closer to the ground truth and the expressions are more concise. Meanwhile we find the solution of BSR is robust to hyper-parameter specifications such as the number of trees.},

The design of the Jupyter notebook is in many ways well suited for teaching subjects in information technology and computer science, but it is a tool that departs significantly from a standard text editor or integrated development environment, and thus carries with it several unique advantages as well as several surprising potential pitfalls. As use of Jupyter notebooks has grown, so has criticism of the notebook, for varied reasons: notebooks can behave in unexpected ways, they can be difficult to reproduce, they open up potential security issues, and they may encourage poor coding practices. A set of best practices to guide instructors and help addressing these concerns when using Jupyter notebooks in the classroom is currently lacking. This paper addresses the strengths and weaknesses of the Jupyter notebook for education, drawing on existing literature as well as the author's experience teaching a range of courses with Jupyter notebooks for over five years, and recommends a set of best practices for teaching with the Jupyter notebook.},

We use numerical simulations to explore the evolution of debris from a tidally disrupted satellite, with the aim of developing a method that can be used to identify and quantify signatures of accretion in a survey of halo stars. For a Milky Way with a spherical halo, we find that debris from minor mergers can remain aligned along great circles throughout the lifetime of the Galaxy. We exploit this result to develop the method of great circle cell counts (GC3), which we test by applying it to artificially constructed halo distributions. Our results suggest that if as few as 1 \% of the stars in a halo survey are accreted from the disruption of a single subsystem smaller than the Large Magellanic Cloud, GC3 can recover the great circle associated with this debris. The dispersion in GC3 can also be used to detect the presence of structure characteristic of accretion in distributions containing a much smaller percentage of material accreted from any single satellite.},

  abstract = {Symbolic regression, the task of predicting the mathematical expression of a function from the observation of its values, is a difficult task which usually involves a two-step procedure: predicting the "skeleton" of the expression up to the choice of numerical constants, then fitting the constants by optimizing a non-convex loss function. The dominant approach is genetic programming, which evolves candidates by iterating this subroutine a large number of times. Neural networks have recently been tasked to predict the correct skeleton in a single try, but remain much less powerful. In this paper, we challenge this two-step procedure, and task a Transformer to directly predict the full mathematical expression, constants included. One can subsequently refine the predicted constants by feeding them to the non-convex optimizer as an informed initialization. We present ablations to show that this end-to-end approach yields better results, sometimes even without the refinement step. We evaluate our model on problems from the SRBench benchmark and show that our model approaches the performance of state-of-the-art genetic programming with several orders of magnitude faster inference.},

PySINDy is a Python package that provides tools for applying the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) approach to data-driven model discovery. In this major update to PySINDy, we implement several advanced features that enable the discovery of more general differential equations from noisy and limited data. The library of candidate terms is extended for the identification of actuated systems, partial differential equations (PDEs), and implicit differential equations. Robust formulations, including the integral form of SINDy and ensembling techniques, are also implemented to improve performance for real-world data. Finally, we provide a range of new optimization algorithms, including several sparse regression techniques and algorithms to enforce and promote inequality constraints and stability. Together, these updates enable entirely new SINDy model discovery capabilities that have not been reported in the literature, such as constrained PDE identification and ensembling with different sparse regression optimizers.},

  abstract = {Despite great progress in simulating multiphysics problems using the numerical discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs), one still cannot seamlessly incorporate noisy data into existing algorithms, mesh generation remains complex, and high-dimensional problems governed by parameterized PDEs cannot be tackled. Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.},

Our information extraction algorithm identifies the axes of the figures, extracts text blocks like axes-labels and legends and identifies data points in the figure. It also extracts the units appearing in the axes labels and segments the legends to identify the different lines in the legend, the different symbols and their associated text explanations. Our algorithm also performs the challenging task of separating out overlapping text and data points effectively. Our experiments indicate that these techniques are computationally efficient and provide acceptable accuracy.},

The efficiency takes the minimum values in between 1.1 and 1.2 M\textsubscript{solar} WD for a given mass accretion rate, as well as increases in both less and more massive WDs.

Test performance on metrics such as Z500 (geopotential height) and T850 (temperature) improves upon previous data-driven approaches and is comparable to operational, full-resolution, physical models from GFS and ECMWF, at least when evaluated on 1-degree scales and when using reanalysis initial conditions.

These derivatives are efficient to compute with Taylor-mode automatic differentiation. Optimizing this additional objective trades model performance against the time cost of solving the learned dynamics.

The rule, derived from Bayesian principles, yields a wide-range of algorithms from fields such as optimization, deep learning, and graphical models. This includes classical algorithms such as ridge regression, Newton's method, and Kalman filter, as well as modern deep-learning algorithms such as stochastic-gradient descent, RMSprop, and Dropout. The key idea in deriving such algorithms is to approximate the posterior using candidate distributions estimated by using natural gradients. Different candidate distributions result in different algorithms and further approximations to natural gradients give rise to variants of those algorithms. Our work not only unifies, generalizes, and improves existing algorithms, but also helps us design new ones.},

  abstract = {The conjoining of dynamical systems and deep learning has become a topic of great interest. In particular, neural differential equations (NDEs) demonstrate that neural networks and differential equation are two sides of the same coin. Traditional parameterised differential equations are a special case. Many popular neural network architectures, such as residual networks and recurrent networks, are discretisations. NDEs are suitable for tackling generative problems, dynamical systems, and time series (particularly in physics, finance, ...) and are thus of interest to both modern machine learning and traditional mathematical modelling. NDEs offer high-capacity function approximation, strong priors on model space, the ability to handle irregular data, memory efficiency, and a wealth of available theory on both sides. This doctoral thesis provides an in-depth survey of the field. Topics include: neural ordinary differential equations (e.g. for hybrid neural/mechanistic modelling of physical systems); neural controlled differential equations (e.g. for learning functions of irregular time series); and neural stochastic differential equations (e.g. to produce generative models capable of representing complex stochastic dynamics, or sampling from complex high-dimensional distributions). Further topics include: numerical methods for NDEs (e.g. reversible differential equations solvers, backpropagation through differential equations, Brownian reconstruction); symbolic regression for dynamical systems (e.g. via regularised evolution); and deep implicit models (e.g. deep equilibrium models, differentiable optimisation). We anticipate this thesis will be of interest to anyone interested in the marriage of deep learning with dynamical systems, and hope it will provide a useful reference for the current state of the art.},

Each function models the distribution of the output given an input, conditioned on the context. NPs have the benefit of fitting observed data efficiently with linear complexity in the number of context input-output pairs, and can learn a wide family of conditional distributions; they learn predictive distributions conditioned on context sets of arbitrary size. Nonetheless, we show that NPs suffer a fundamental drawback of underfitting, giving inaccurate predictions at the inputs of the observed data they condition on. We address this issue by incorporating attention into NPs, allowing each input location to attend to the relevant context points for the prediction. We show that this greatly improves the accuracy of predictions, results in noticeably faster training, and expands the range of functions that can be modelled.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Those universal properties, largely determining their physical characteristics, are revealed by the powerful renormalization group (RG) procedure, which systematically retains "slow" degrees of freedom and integrates out the rest. However, the important degrees of freedom may be difficult to identify. Here we demonstrate a machine learning algorithm capable of identifying the relevant degrees of freedom and executing RG steps iteratively without any prior knowledge about the system. We introduce an artificial neural network based on a model-independent, information-theoretic characterization of a real-space RG procedure, performing this task. We apply the algorithm to classical statistical physics problems in one and two dimensions. We demonstrate RG flow and extract the Ising critical exponent. Our results demonstrate that machine learning techniques can extract abstract physical concepts and consequently become an integral part of theory- and model-building.},

  abstract = {In this chapter we examine how multi-objective genetic programming can be used to perform symbolic regression and compare its performance to single-objective genetic programming. Multi-objective optimization is implemented by using a slightly adapted version of NSGA-II, where the optimization objectives are the model’s prediction accuracy and its complexity. As the model complexity is explicitly defined as an objective, the evolved symbolic regression models are simpler and more parsimonious when compared to models generated by a single-objective algorithm. Furthermore, we define a new complexity measure that includes syntactical and semantic information about the model, while still being efficiently computed, and demonstrate its performance on several benchmark problems. As a result of the multi-objective approach the appropriate model length and the functions included in the models are automatically determined without the necessity to specify them a-priori.},

We employ the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm for parameter optimization and calculate gradients via automatic differentiation. We provide examples where the parameter identification succeeds and fails and highlight its computational overhead. Using an extensive suite of symbolic regression benchmark problems we demonstrate the increased performance when incorporating nonlinear least squares within genetic programming. Our results are compared with recently published results obtained by several genetic programming variants and state of the art machine learning algorithms. Genetic programming with nonlinear least squares performs among the best on the defined benchmark suite and the local search can be easily integrated in different genetic programming algorithms as long as only differentiable functions are used within the models.},

  abstract = {Sequence prediction and classification are ubiquitous and challenging problems in machine learning that can require identifying complex dependencies between temporally distant inputs. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have the ability, in theory, to cope with these temporal dependencies by virtue of the short-term memory implemented by their recurrent (feedback) connections. However, in practice they are difficult to train successfully when long-term memory is required. This paper introduces a simple, yet powerful modification to the simple RNN (SRN) architecture, the Clockwork RNN (CW-RNN), in which the hidden layer is partitioned into separate modules, each processing inputs at its own temporal granularity, making computations only at its prescribed clock rate. Rather than making the standard RNN models more complex, CW-RNN reduces the number of SRN parameters, improves the performance significantly in the tasks tested, and speeds up the network evaluation. The network is demonstrated in preliminary experiments involving three tasks: audio signal generation, TIMIT spoken word classification, where it outperforms both SRN and LSTM networks, and online handwriting recognition, where it outperforms SRNs.}

When viewed in this way, the process of solving these problems becomes equivalent to searching a space of possible computer programs for a highly fit individual computer program. The recently developed genetic programming paradigm described herein provides a way to search the space of possible computer programs for a highly fit individual computer program to solve (or approximately solve) a surprising variety of different problems from different fields. In genetic programming, populations of computer programs are genetically bred using the Darwinian principle of survival of the fittest and using a genetic crossover (sexual recombination) operator appropriate for genetically mating computer programs. Genetic programming is illustrated via an example of machine learning of the Boolean 11-multiplexer function and symbolic regression of the econometric exchange equation from noisy empirical data.},

  abstract = {We present GIGANTES, the most extensive and realistic void catalog suite ever released—containing over 1 billion cosmic voids covering a volume larger than the observable universe, more than 20 TB of data, and created by running the void finder VIDE on QUIJOTE’s halo simulations. The GIGANTES suite, spanning thousands of cosmological models, opens up the study of voids, answering compelling questions: Do voids carry unique cosmological information? How is this information correlated with galaxy information? Leveraging the large number of voids in the GIGANTES suite, our Fisher constraints demonstrate voids contain additional information, critically tightening constraints on cosmological parameters. We use traditional void summary statistics (void size function, void density profile) and the void autocorrelation function, which independently yields an error of 0.13 eV on ∑ m ν for a 1 h −3 Gpc3 simulation, without cosmic microwave background priors. Combining halos and voids we forecast an error of 0.09 eV from the same volume, representing a gain of 60\% compared to halos alone. Extrapolating to next generation multi-Gpc3 surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, Euclid, the Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe and Ices Explorer, and the Roman Space Telescope, we expect voids should yield an independent determination of neutrino mass. Crucially, GIGANTES is the first void catalog suite expressly built for intensive machine-learning exploration. We illustrate this by training a neural network to perform likelihood-free inference on the void size function, giving a ∼20\% constraint on Ωm. Cosmology problems provide an impetus to develop novel deep-learning techniques. With GIGANTES, machine learning gains an impressive data set, offering unique problems that will stimulate new techniques.},

We want to comprehend how the oracle conceived these predictions. This feat, denoted as scientific understanding, has frequently been recognized as the essential aim of science.

We are convinced that this is not a mere technical question but lies at the core of science. Therefore, here we set out to answer where we are and where we can go from here. We first seek advice from the philosophy of science to understand scientific understanding. Then we review the current state of the art, both from literature and by collecting dozens of anecdotes from scientists about how they acquired new conceptual understanding with the help of computers. Those combined insights help us to define three dimensions of android-assisted scientific understanding: The android as a I) computational microscope, II) resource of inspiration and the ultimate, not yet existent III) agent of understanding. For each dimension, we explain new avenues to push beyond the status quo and unleash the full power of artificial intelligence's contribution to the central aim of science.

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overriding in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

However, generative modeling of discrete data such as arithmetic expressions and molecular structures still poses significant challenges. Crucially, state-of-the-art methods often produce outputs that are not valid. We make the key observation that frequently, discrete data can be represented as a parse tree from a context-free grammar. We propose a variational autoencoder which encodes and decodes directly to and from these parse trees, ensuring the generated outputs are always valid. Surprisingly, we show that not only does our model more often generate valid outputs, it also learns a more coherent latent space in which nearby points decode to similar discrete outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned models by showing their improved performance in Bayesian optimization for symbolic regression and molecular synthesis.},

In this paper, we address this shortcoming by introducing an open-source, reproducible benchmarking platform for symbolic regression. We assess 14 symbolic regression methods and 7 machine learning methods on a set of 252 diverse regression problems. Our assessment includes both real-world datasets with no known model form as well as ground-truth benchmark problems, including physics equations and systems of ordinary differential equations. For the real-world datasets, we benchmark the ability of each method to learn models with low error and low complexity relative to state-of-the-art machine learning methods. For the synthetic problems, we assess each method's ability to find exact solutions in the presence of varying levels of noise. Under these controlled experiments, we conclude that the best performing methods for real-world regression combine genetic algorithms with parameter estimation and/or semantic search drivers. When tasked with recovering exact equations in the presence of noise, we find that deep learning and genetic algorithm-based approaches perform similarly. We provide a detailed guide to reproducing this experiment and contributing new methods, and encourage other researchers to collaborate with us on a common and living symbolic regression benchmark.},

It performs well in discrete error spaces but not on the continuous-valued problems that compose most system identification tasks. In this paper, we develop a new form of lexicase selection for symbolic regression, named ε-lexicase selection, that redefines the pass condition for individuals on each test case in a more effective way. We run a series of experiments on real-world and synthetic problems with several treatments of ε and quantify how ε affects parent selection and model performance. ε-lexicase selection is shown to be effective for regression, producing better fit models compared to other techniques such as tournament selection and age-fitness Pareto optimization. We demonstrate that ε can be adapted automatically for individual test cases based on the population performance distribution. Our experiments show that ε-lexicase selection with automatic ε produces the most accurate models across tested problems with negligible computational overhead. We show that behavioral diversity is exceptionally high in lexicase selection treatments, and that ε-lexicase selection makes use of more fitness cases when selecting parents than lexicase selection, which helps explain the performance improvement.},

  abstract = {We introduce a method to enhance the inference of meaningful dynamic models from observational data by genetic programming (GP). This method incorporates an inheritable epigenetic layer that specifies active and inactive genes for a more effective local search of the model structure space. We define several GP implementations using different features of epigenetics, such as passive structure, phenotypic plasticity, and inheritable gene regulation. To test these implementations, we use hundreds of data sets generated from nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in several fields of engineering and from randomly constructed nonlinear ODE models. The results indicate that epigenetic hill climbing consistently produces more compact dynamic equations with better fitness values, and that it identifies the exact solution of the system more often, validating the categorical improvement of GP by epigenetic local search. The results further indicate that when faced with complex dynamics, epigenetic hill climbing reduces the computational effort required to infer the correct underlying dynamics. We then apply the method to the identification of three real-world systems: a cascaded tanks system, a chemical distillation tower, and an industrial wind turbine. We analyze its solutions in comparison to theoretical and black-box approaches in terms of accuracy and intelligibility. Finally, we analyze population homology to evaluate the efficiency of the method. The results indicate that the epigenetic implementations provide protection from premature convergence by maintaining diversity in silenced portions of programs.},

Whereas previous work has demonstrated the ability of lexicase selection to solve difficult problems in program synthesis and symbolic regression, the central goal of this paper is to develop the theoretical underpinnings that explain its performance. To this end, we derive an analytical formula that gives the expected probabilities of selection under lexicase selection, given a population and its behavior. In addition, we expand upon the relation of lexicase selection to many-objective optimization methods to describe the behavior of lexicase selection, which is to select individuals on the boundaries of Pareto fronts in high-dimensional space. We show analytically why lexicase selection performs more poorly for certain sizes of population and training cases, and show why it has been shown to perform more poorly in continuous error spaces. To address this last concern, we propose new variants of epsilon-lexicase selection, a method that modifies the pass condition in lexicase selection to allow near-elite individuals to pass cases, thereby improving selection performance with continuous errors. We show that epsilon-lexicase outperforms several diversity-maintenance strategies on a number of real-world and synthetic regression problems.},

  abstract = {Graph data are pervasive in many real-world applications. Recently, increasing attention has been paid on graph neural networks (GNNs), which aim to model the local graph structures and capture the hierarchical patterns by aggregating the information from neighbors with stackable network modules. Motivated by the observation that different nodes often require different iterations of aggregation to fully capture the structural information, in this paper, we propose to explicitly sample diverse iterations of aggregation for different nodes to boost the performance of GNNs. It is a challenging task to develop an effective aggregation strategy for each node, given complex graphs and sparse features. Moreover, it is not straightforward to derive an efficient algorithm since we need to feed the sampled nodes into different number of network layers. To address the above challenges, we propose Policy-GNN, a meta-policy framework that models the sampling procedure and message passing of GNNs into a combined learning process. Specifically, Policy-GNN uses a meta-policy to adaptively determine the number of aggregations for each node. The meta-policy is trained with deep reinforcement learning\textasciitilde (RL) by exploiting the feedback from the model. We further introduce parameter sharing and a buffer mechanism to boost the training efficiency. Experimental results on three real-world benchmark datasets suggest that Policy-GNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives, showing the promise in aggregation optimization for GNNs.},

A time-dependent diffusion model based on a vibrational instability analysis is adopted in order to describe mixing of layers having a gradient of mean molecular weight (semiconvection). The fully-convective layers are determined according to the Ledoux criterion. For comparison, evolutionary sequences are also calculated for the same masses without assuming semiconvection but using the Schwarzschild criterion for convective instability. It is found that the vibrational instability does not establish the Schwarzschild-Haerm criterion for semiconvection during the fast phases of evolution, such as shell hydrogen burning. The modification of the chemical profile by semiconvection during this phase does strongly affect the evolutionary tracks in the H-R diagram during core helium burning. The results are discussed in comparison to earlier calculations of massive star evolution with and without inclusion of semiconvection.},

  abstract = {We present a hierarchical probabilistic model for improving geometric stellar distance estimates using color-magnitude information. This is achieved with a data-driven model of the color-magnitude diagram, not relying on stellar models but instead on the relative abundances of stars in color-magnitude cells, which are inferred from very noisy magnitudes and parallaxes. While the resulting noise-deconvolved color-magnitude diagram can be useful for a range of applications, we focus on deriving improved stellar distance estimates relying on both parallax and photometric information. We demonstrate the efficiency of this approach on the 1.4 million stars of the Gaia TGAS sample that also have AAVSO Photometric All Sky Survey magnitudes. Our hierarchical model has 4 million parameters in total, most of which are marginalized out numerically or analytically. We find that distance estimates are significantly improved for the noisiest parallaxes and densest regions of the color-magnitude diagram. In particular, the average distance signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and uncertainty improve by 19\% and 36\%, respectively, with 8\% of the objects improving in S/N by a factor greater than 2. This computationally efficient approach fully accounts for both parallax and photometric noise and is a first step toward a full hierarchical probabilistic model of the Gaia data.},

  abstract = {Simulation-based inference (SBI) is rapidly establishing itself as a standard machine learning technique for analyzing data in cosmological surveys. Despite continual improvements to the quality of density estimation by learned models, applications of such techniques to real data are entirely reliant on the generalization power of neural networks far outside the training distribution, which is mostly unconstrained. Due to the imperfections in scientist-created simulations, and the large computational expense of generating all possible parameter combinations, SBI methods in cosmology are vulnerable to such generalization issues. Here, we discuss the effects of both issues, and show how using a Bayesian neural network framework for training SBI can mitigate biases, and result in more reliable inference outside the training set. We introduce cosmoSWAG, the first application of Stochastic Weight Averaging to cosmology, and apply it to SBI trained for inference on the cosmic microwave background.},

  abstract = {Electron transfer is the most elementary process in nature, but the existing electron transfer rules are seldom applied to high-pressure situations, such as in the deep Earth. Here we show a deep learning model to obtain the electronegativity of 96 elements under arbitrary pressure, and a regressed unified formula to quantify its relationship with pressure and electronic configuration. The relative work function of minerals is further predicted by electronegativity, presenting a decreasing trend with pressure because of pressure-induced electron delocalization. Using the work function as the case study of electronegativity, it reveals that~the driving force behind directional electron transfer results from the enlarged work function difference between compounds with pressure. This well explains the deep high-conductivity anomalies, and helps discover the redox reactivity between widespread Fe(II)-bearing minerals and water during ongoing subduction. Our results give an insight into the fundamental physicochemical properties of elements and their compounds under pressure.},

  abstract = {The Observation--Hypothesis--Prediction--Experimentation loop paradigm for scientific research has been practiced by researchers for years towards scientific discoveries. However, with data explosion in both mega-scale and milli-scale scientific research, it has been sometimes very difficult to manually analyze the data and propose new hypothesis to drive the cycle for scientific discovery. In this paper, we discuss the role of Explainable AI in scientific discovery process by demonstrating an Explainable AI-based paradigm for science discovery. The key is to use Explainable AI to help derive data or model interpretations as well as scientific discoveries or insights. We show how computational and data-intensive methodology -- together with experimental and theoretical methodology -- can be seamlessly integrated for scientific research. To demonstrate the AI-based science discovery process, and to pay our respect to some of the greatest minds in human history, we show how Kepler's laws of planetary motion and the Newton's law of universal gravitation can be rediscovered by (Explainable) AI based on Tycho Brahe's astronomical observation data, whose works were leading the scientific revolution in the 16-17th century. This work also highlights the important role of Explainable AI (as compared to Blackbox AI) in science discovery to help humans prevent or better prepare for the possible technological singularity that may happen in the future.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context. Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} Data Release 2 (\emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2) contains results for 1693 million sources in the magnitude range 3 to 21 based on observations collected by the European Space Agency \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} satellite during the first 22 months of its operational phase.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} We describe the input data, models, and processing used for the astrometric content of \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2, and the validation of these resultsperformed within the astrometry task.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} Some 320 billion centroid positions from the pre-processed astrometric CCD observations were used to estimate the five astrometric parameters (positions, parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1332 million sources, and approximate positions at the reference epoch J2015.5 for an additional 361 million mostly faint sources. These data were calculated in two steps. First, the satellite attitude and the astrometric calibration parameters of the CCDs were obtained in an astrometric global iterative solution for 16 million selected sources, using about 1\% of the input data. This primary solution was tied to the extragalactic International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) by means of quasars. The resulting attitude and calibration were then used to calculate the astrometric parameters of all the sources. Special validation solutions were used to characterise the random and systematic errors in parallax and proper motion.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} For the sources with five-parameter astrometric solutions, the median uncertainty in parallax and position at the reference epoch J2015.5 is about 0.04 mas for bright (\emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$} {$<$} 14 mag) sources, 0.1 mas at \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$} = 17 mag, and 0.7 masat \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$} = 20 mag. In the proper motion components the corresponding uncertainties are 0.05, 0.2, and 1.2 mas yr\textsuperscript{−1{$<$}sup/{$>$}, respectively.The optical reference frame defined by \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 is aligned with ICRS and is non-rotating with respect to the quasars to within 0.15 mas yr\textsuperscript{−1{$<$}sup/{$>$}. From the quasars and validation solutions we estimate that systematics in the parallaxes depending on position, magnitude, and colour are generally below 0.1 mas, but the parallaxes are on the whole too small by about 0.03 mas. Significant spatial correlations of up to 0.04 mas in parallax and 0.07 mas yr\textsuperscript{−1{$<$}sup/{$>$} in proper motion are seen on small ({$<$} 1 deg) and intermediate (20 deg) angular scales. Important statistics and information for the users of the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 astrometry are given in the appendices.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Countless learning tasks require dealing with sequential data. Image captioning, speech synthesis, and music generation all require that a model produce outputs that are sequences. In other domains, such as time series prediction, video analysis, and musical information retrieval, a model must learn from inputs that are sequences. Interactive tasks, such as translating natural language, engaging in dialogue, and controlling a robot, often demand both capabilities. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dynamics of sequences via cycles in the network of nodes. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, recurrent networks retain a state that can represent information from an arbitrarily long context window. Although recurrent neural networks have traditionally been difficult to train, and often contain millions of parameters, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful large-scale learning with them. In recent years, systems based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional (BRNN) architectures have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on tasks as varied as image captioning, language translation, and handwriting recognition. In this survey, we review and synthesize the research that over the past three decades first yielded and then made practical these powerful learning models.

  abstract = {In genetic programming (GP), the outcomes of the evaluation phase can be represented as an interaction matrix, with rows corresponding to programs in a population and columns corresponding to tests that define a program synthesis task. Recent contributions on Discovery of Objectives via Clustering (DOC) and Discovery of Objectives by Factorization of interaction matrix (DOF) show that informative characterizations of programs can be automatically derived from interaction matrices in discrete domains and used as search objectives in multidimensional setting. In this paper, we propose analogous methods for continuous domains and compare them with conventional GP that uses tournament selection, Age-Fitness Pareto Optimization, and GP with epsilon-lexicase selection. Experiments show that the proposed methods are effective for symbolic regression, systematically producing better-fitting models than the two former baselines, and surpassing epsilon-lexicase selection on some problems. We also investigate the hybrids of the proposed approach with the baselines, concluding that hybridization of DOC with epsilon-lexicase leads to the best overall results.},

  abstract = {Automatic decision-making approaches, such as reinforcement learning (RL), have been applied to (partially) solve the resource allocation problem adaptively in the cloud computing system. However, a complete cloud resource allocation framework exhibits high dimensions in state and action spaces, which prohibit the usefulness of traditional RL techniques. In addition, high power consumption has become one of the critical concerns in design and control of cloud computing systems, which degrades system reliability and increases cooling cost. An effective dynamic power management (DPM) policy should minimize power consumption while maintaining performance degradation within an acceptable level. Thus, a joint virtual machine (VM) resource allocation and power management framework is critical to the overall cloud computing system. Moreover, novel solution framework is necessary to address the even higher dimensions in state and action spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical framework for solving the overall resource allocation and power management problem in cloud computing systems. The proposed hierarchical framework comprises a global tier for VM resource allocation to the servers and a local tier for distributed power management of local servers. The emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique, which can deal with complicated control problems with large state space, is adopted to solve the global tier problem. Furthermore, an autoencoder and a novel weight sharing structure are adopted to handle the high-dimensional state space and accelerate the convergence speed. On the other hand, the local tier of distributed server power managements comprises an LSTM based workload predictor and a model-free RL based power manager, operating in a distributed manner. Experiment results using actual Google cluster traces show that our proposed hierarchical framework significantly saves the power consumption and energy usage than the baseline while achieving no severe latency degradation. Meanwhile, the proposed framework can achieve the best trade-off between latency and power/energy consumption in a server cluster.},

  abstract = {Novelties are part of our daily lives. We constantly adopt new technologies, conceive new ideas, meet new people, experiment with new situations. Occasionally, we as individuals, in a complicated cognitive and sometimes fortuitous process, come up with something that is not only new to us, but to our entire society so that what is a personal novelty can turn into an innovation at a global level. Innovations occur throughout social, biological and technological systems and, though we perceive them as a very natural ingredient of our human experience, little is known about the processes determining their emergence. Still the statistical occurrence of innovations shows striking regularities that represent a starting point to get a deeper insight in the whole phenomenology. This paper represents a small step in that direction, focusing on reviewing the scientific attempts to effectively model the emergence of the new and its regularities, with an emphasis on more recent contributions: from the plain Simon's model tracing back to the 1950s, to the newest model of Polya's urn with triggering of one novelty by another. What seems to be key in the successful modelling schemes proposed so far is the idea of looking at evolution as a path in a complex space, physical, conceptual, biological, technological, whose structure and topology get continuously reshaped and expanded by the occurrence of the new. Mathematically it is very interesting to look at the consequences of the interplay between the "actual" and the "possible" and this is the aim of this short review.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The advent of humanoid robots has enabled a new approach to investigating the acquisition of language, and we report on the development of robots able to acquire rudimentary linguistic skills. Our work focuses on early stages analogous to some characteristics of a human child of about 6 to 14 months, the transition from babbling to first word forms. We investigate one mechanism among many that may contribute to this process, a key factor being the sensitivity of learners to the statistical distribution of linguistic elements. As well as being necessary for learning word meanings, the acquisition of anchor word forms facilitates the segmentation of an acoustic stream through other mechanisms. In our experiments some salient one-syllable word forms are learnt by a humanoid robot in real-time interactions with naive participants. Words emerge from random syllabic babble through a learning process based on a dialogue between the robot and the human participant, whose speech is perceived by the robot as a stream of phonemes. Numerous ways of representing the speech as syllabic segments are possible. Furthermore, the pronunciation of many words in spontaneous speech is variable. However, in line with research elsewhere, we observe that salient content words are more likely than function words to have consistent canonical representations; thus their relative frequency increases, as does their influence on the learner. Variable pronunciation may contribute to early word form acquisition. The importance of contingent interaction in real-time between teacher and learner is reflected by a reinforcement process, with variable success. The examination of individual cases may be more informative than group results. Nevertheless, word forms are usually produced by the robot after a few minutes of dialogue, employing a simple, real-time, frequency dependent mechanism. This work shows the potential of human-robot interaction systems in studies of the dynamics of early language acquisition.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Understanding the formation of stars in galaxies is central to much of modern astrophysics. However, a quantitative prediction of the star formation rate and the initial distribution of stellar masses remains elusive. For several decades it has been thought that the star formation process is primarily controlled by the interplay between gravity and magnetostatic support, modulated by neutral-ion drift (known as ambipolar diffusion in astrophysics). Recently, however, both observational and numerical work has begun to suggest that supersonic turbulent flows rather than static magnetic fields control star formation. To some extent, this represents a return to ideas popular before the importance of magnetic fields to the interstellar gas was fully appreciated. This review gives a historical overview of the successes and problems of both the classical dynamical theory and the standard theory of magnetostatic support, from both observational and theoretical perspectives. The outline of a new theory relying on control by driven supersonic turbulence is then presented. Numerical models demonstrate that, although supersonic turbulence can provide global support, it nevertheless produces density enhancements that allow local collapse. Inefficient, isolated star formation is a hallmark of turbulent support, while efficient, clustered star formation occurs in its absence. The consequences of this theory are then explored for both local star formation and galactic-scale star formation. It suggests that individual star-forming cores are likely not quasistatic objects, but dynamically collapsing. Accretion onto these objects varies depending on the properties of the surrounding turbulent flow; numerical models agree with observations showing decreasing rates. The initial mass distribution of stars may also be determined by the turbulent flow. Molecular clouds appear to be transient objects forming and dissolving in the larger-scale turbulent flow, or else quickly collapsing into regions of violent star formation. Global star formation in galaxies appears to be controlled by the same balance between gravity and turbulence as small-scale star formation, although modulated by cooling and differential rotation. The dominant driving mechanism in star-forming regions of galaxies appears to be supernovae, while elsewhere coupling of rotation to the gas through magnetic fields or gravity may be important.},

  abstract = {Systematic development of accurate density functionals has been a decades-long challenge for scientists. Despite the emerging application of machine learning (ML) in approximating functionals, the resulting ML functionals usually contain more than tens of thousands parameters, which makes a huge gap in the formulation with the conventional human-designed symbolic functionals. We propose a new framework, Symbolic Functional Evolutionary Search (SyFES), that automatically constructs accurate functionals in the symbolic form, which is more explainable to humans, cheaper to evaluate, and easier to integrate to existing density functional theory codes than other ML functionals. We first show that without prior knowledge, SyFES reconstructed a known functional from scratch. We then demonstrate that evolving from an existing functional \$\textbackslash omega\$B97M-V, SyFES found a new functional, GAS22 (Google Accelerated Science 22), that performs better for the majority of molecular types in the test set of Main Group Chemistry Database (MGCDB84). Our framework opens a new direction in leveraging computing power for the systematic development of symbolic density functionals.},

Then, an approach to explaining representations encoded by neurons was proposed. The approach is based on generating images maximizing an activation in the model. A comparison of the visualization results with the experimental data suggests that the approach can be used to study the properties of the higher-level areas of the visual cortex.},

Here, we test the method with real proper motion data from the Pan-STARRS1 survey, and by selecting targets down to r0 = 18.5 mag we show that it is able to detect the GD-1 stellar stream, whereas the structure remains below a useful detection limit when using a Matched Filter technique. The radial velocity solutions provided by STREAMFINDER for GD-1 candidate members are found to be in good agreement with observations. Furthermore, our algorithm detects a \{˜ \} 40° long structure approximately parallel to GD-1, and which fans out from it, possibly a sign of stream-fanning due to the triaxiality of the Galactic potential. This analysis shows the promise of this method for detecting and analysing stellar streams in the upcoming Gaia DR2 catalogue.},

  abstract = {We present a large set of theoretical isochrones, whose distinctive features mostly reside on the greatly-improved treatment of the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase. Essentially, we have coupled the TP-AGB tracks described in Paper I, at their stages of pre-flash quiescent H-shell burning, with the evolutionary tracks for the previous evolutionary phases from Girardi et al. (2000, A\&amp;AS, 141, 371). Theoretical isochrones for any intermediate value of age and metallicity are then derived by interpolation in the grids. We take care that the isochrones keep, to a good level of detail, the several peculiarities present in these TP-AGB tracks - e.g., the cool tails of C-type stars owing to the use of proper molecular opacities as convective dredge-up occurs along the TP-AGB; the bell-shaped sequences in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram for stars with hot-bottom burning; the changes of pulsation mode between fundamental and first overtone; the sudden changes of mean mass-loss rates as the surface chemistry changes from M- to C-type; etc. Theoretical isochrones are then converted to about 20 different photometric systems - including traditional ground-based systems, and those of recent major wide-field surveys such as SDSS, OGLE, DENIS, 2MASS, UKIDSS, etc., - by means of synthetic photometry applied to an updated library of stellar spectra, suitably extended to include C-type stars. Finally, we correct the predicted photometry for the effect of circumstellar dust during the mass-losing stages of the AGB evolution, which allows us to improve the results for the optical-to-infrared systems, and to simulate mid- and far-IR systems such as those of Spitzer and AKARI. We illustrate the most striking properties of these isochrones by means of basic comparisons with observational data for the Milky Way disc and the Magellanic Clouds. Access to the data is provided both via a web repository of static tables (http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/dustyAGB07 and CDS), and via an interactive web interface (http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cmd), which provides tables for any intermediate value of age and metallicity, for several photometric systems, and for different choices of dust properties.},

  abstract = {We reveal the highly structured nature of the Milky Way (MW) stellar halo within the footprint of the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS) photometric survey from blue main sequence (MS) and MS turn-off stars. We map no fewer than five stellar structures within a heliocentric range of 5-30 kpc. Some of these are known (the Monoceros Ring, the Pisces/Triangulum globular cluster stream), but we also uncover three well-defined stellar structures that could be, at least partly, responsible for the so-called Triangulum/Andromeda and Triangulum/Andromeda 2 features. In particular, we trace a new faint stellar stream located at a heliocentric distance of 17 kpc. With a surface brightness of Σ V 32-32.5 mag arcsec –2 , it follows an orbit that is almost parallel to the Galactic plane north of M31 and has so far eluded surveys of the MW halo as these tend to steer away from regions dominated by the Galactic disk. Investigating our follow-up spectroscopic observations of PAndAS, we serendipitously uncover a radial velocity signature from stars that have colors and magnitudes compatible with the stream. From the velocity of eight likely member stars, we show that this stellar structure is dynamically cold, with an unresolved velocity dispersion that is lower than 7.1 km s –1 at the 90\% confidence level. Along with the width of the stream (300-650 pc), its dynamics point to a dwarf-galaxy-accretion origin. The numerous stellar structures we can map in the MW stellar halo between 5 and 30 kpc and their varying morphology is a testament to the complex nature of the stellar halo at these intermediate distances.},

  abstract = {The physical characteristics and atmospheric chemical composition of newly discovered exoplanets are often inferred from their transit spectra, which are obtained from complex numerical models of radiative transfer. Alternatively, simple analytical expressions provide insightful physical intuition into the relevant atmospheric processes. The deep-learning revolution has opened the door for deriving such analytical results directly with a computer algorithm fitting to the data. As a proof of concept, we successfully demonstrate the use of symbolic regression on synthetic data for the transit radii of generic hot-Jupiter exoplanets to derive a corresponding analytical formula. As a preprocessing step, we use dimensional analysis to identify the relevant dimensionless combinations of variables and reduce the number of independent inputs, which improves the performance of the symbolic regression. The dimensional analysis also allowed us to mathematically derive and properly parameterize the most general family of degeneracies among the input atmospheric parameters that affect the characterization of an exoplanet atmosphere through transit spectroscopy.},

The original method looks for streamers along great circles in the sky, our extension adds the kinematical restriction that velocity vectors should also be constrained to lie along these great circles, as seen by a Galactocentric observer. We show how to use these combined criteria starting from heliocentric observables. We test it by using the mock Gaia catalogue of Brown et al., which includes a realistic Galactic background and observational errors, but with the addition of detailed star formation histories for the simulated satellites. We investigate its success rate as a function of initial satellite luminosity, star formation history and orbit. We find that the inclusion of the kinematical restriction vastly enhances the contrast between a streamer and the background, even in the presence of observational errors, provided we use only data with good astrometric quality (fractional errors of 30 per cent or better). The global nature of the method diminishes the erasing effect of phase mixing and permits the recovery of merger events of reasonable dynamical age. Satellites with a star formation history different to that of the Galactic background are also better isolated. We find that satellites in the range of 108-109 L⊙ can be recovered even for events as old as ˜10 Gyr. Even satellites with 4-5 × 107 L⊙ can be recovered for certain combinations of dynamical ages and orbits.},

To test this, we apply nGC3, a great-circle-cell count method that combines position and proper motion data to identify streams, to 10 mock Gaia catalogues of K giants and RR Lyrae stars constructed from cosmological simulations of Milky Way analogues. We analyse two sets of simulations, one using a combination of N-body and semi-analytical methods, which has extremely high resolution, the other using hydrodynamical methods, which captures the dynamics of baryons, including the formation of an in situ halo. These 10 realizations of plausible Galactic merger histories allow us to assess the potential for the recovery of tidal streams in different Milky Way formation scenarios. We include the Gaia selection function and observational errors in these mock catalogues. We find that the nGC3 method has a well-defined detection boundary in the space of stream width and projected overdensity, which can be predicted based on direct observables alone. We predict that about 4-13 dwarf galaxy streams can be detected in a typical Milky Way-mass halo with Gaia+nGC3, with an estimated efficiency of \&gt;80 per cent inside the detection boundary. The progenitors of these streams are in the mass range of the classical dwarf galaxies and may have been accreted as early as redshift ̃3. Finally, we analyse how different possible extensions of the Gaia mission will improve the detection of tidal streams.},

  abstract = {Context: The origin of the so called “detached shells” around AGB stars is not fully understood, but two common hypotheses state that these shells form either through the interaction of distinct wind phases or an eruptive mass loss associated with a He-shell flash. We present a model of the formation of detached shells around thermal pulse asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars, based on detailed modelling of mass loss and stellar evolution, leading to a combination of eruptive mass loss and wind interaction. {$<$}BR /{$>$}Aims: The purpose of this paper is first of all to connect stellar evolution with wind and mass loss evolution and demonstrate its consistency with observations, but also to show how thin detached shells around TP-AGB stars can be formed. Previous attempts to link mass loss evolution with the formation of detached shells were based on approximate prescriptions for the mass loss and have not included detailed modelling of the wind formation as we do here. {$<$}BR /{$>$}Methods: Using stellar parameters sampled from an evolutionary track for a 2 \textasciitilde M\_☉ star, we have computed the time evolution of the atmospheric layers and wind acceleration region during a typical thermal pulse with detailed radiation hydrodynamical models including dust formation. Based on these results, we simulate the subsequent circumstellar envelope (CSE) evolution using a spherical hydrodynamic model. {$<$}BR /{$>$}Results: We find that existing simple mass loss prescriptions all suggest different mass loss evolutions and that they differ from our detailed wind modelling. The most important factor for the formation of a detached shell is the wind velocity evolution which has a strong impact on the wind interaction and the resulting pile-up of matter. Our CSE model shows that a thin shell structure may be formed as a consequence of a rather short phase of intense mass loss in combination with a significant variation in the wind velocity, as obtained by our wind models. This situation can only be obtained for a limited range of amplitudes for the piston boundary used in the dynamic atmosphere models. {$<$}BR /{$>$}Conclusions: The combined mass loss eruption and wind interaction scenario for the formation of detached shells around AGB stars (suggested by previous work) is confirmed by the present modelling. Changes in mass loss rate and wind velocity due to a He-shell flash are adequate for creating distinct wind phases and a “snow plow effect” that is necessary to form a geometrically thin detached shell. The derived properties of the shell (i.e. radius, thickness and density) are more or less consistent with existing observational constraints.

This paper reviews models that are based on scale-invariance properties of high-Reynolds-number turbulence in the inertial range. The review starts with the Smagorinsky model, but the focus is on dynamic and similarity subgrid models and on evaluating how well these models reproduce the true impact of the small scales on large-scale physics and how they perform in numerical simulations. Various criteria to evaluate the model performance are discussed, including the so-called a posteriori and a priori studies based on direct numerical simulation and experimental data. Issues are addressed mainly in the context of canonical, incompressible flows, but extensions to scalar-transport, compressible, and reacting flows are also mentioned. Other recent modeling approaches are briefly introduced.},

The selection pressure of tournament selection directly varies with the tournament size --- the more competitors, the higher the resulting selection pressure. This article develops a model, based on order statistics, that can be used to quantitatively predict the resulting selection pressure of a tournament of a given size. This model is used to predict the convergence rates of genetic algorithms utilizing tournament selection. While tournament selection is often used in conjunction with noisy (imperfect) fitness functions, little is understood about how the noise affects the resulting selection pressure. The model is extended to quantitatively predict the selection pressure for tournament selection utilizing noisy fitness functions. Given the tournament size and noise level of a noisy fitness function, the extended model is used to predict the resulting selection pressure of tournament...},

Our results, which were obtained with the hydrodynamics code HERAKLES, suggest that both entropy gradients and entropy barriers are less important for stellar structure than commonly assumed. Our simulations further reveal a new dynamic mixing process operating below the base of shell convection zones.},

  abstract = {Mixing processes in stars driven by composition gradients as a result of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability are not anticipated. They are supported only by hydrodynamic studies of stellar convection. We find that such mixing occurs below the bottom edge of convection zones in our multidimensional hydrodynamic shell convection models. It operates at interfaces created by off-center nuclear burning, where less dense gas with higher mean molecular weight is located above denser gas with a lower mean molecular weight. We discuss the mixing under various conditions with hydrodynamic convection models based on stellar evolutionary calculations of the core helium flash in a 1.25 Msun star, the core carbon flash in a 9.3 Msun star, and of oxygen burning shell in a star with a mass of 23 Msun. We simulate the hydrodynamic behavior of shell convection during various phases of stellar evolution with the Eulerian hydrodynamics code HERAKLES in two and three spatial dimensions. Initial models for this purpose are obtained by state-of-the-art stellar evolutionary codes, namely GARSTEC, STAREVOL, and TYCHO for the core helium flash, core carbon flash, and oxygen shell burning, respectively. Most of our analysis is performed for two-dimensional hydrodynamic models of shell convection during the core helium flash at its peak covering approximately 250 convective turnover timescales. The mixing manifests itself in the form of overdense and cold fingers enriched with matter of higher mean molecular weight, originating from density fluctuations at the lower boundary of the convective shell, and "shooting" down into the core. They result from the Rayleigh-Taylor instability at the lower convection zone boundary due to a negative mean molecular weight gradient. They do not appear when the mean molecular weight gradient is positive.},

  abstract = {Machine-learning models have demonstrated great success in learning complex patterns that enable them to make predictions about unobserved data. In addition to using models for prediction, the ability to interpret what a model has learned is receiving an increasing amount of attention. However, this increased focus has led to considerable confusion about the notion of interpretability. In particular, it is unclear how the wide array of proposed interpretation methods are related, and what common concepts can be used to evaluate them. We aim to address these concerns by defining interpretability in the context of machine learning and introducing the Predictive, Descriptive, Relevant (PDR) framework for discussing interpretations. The PDR framework provides three overarching desiderata for evaluation: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a human audience. Moreover, to help manage the deluge of interpretation methods, we introduce a categorization of existing techniques into model-based and post-hoc categories, with sub-groups including sparsity, modularity and simulatability. To demonstrate how practitioners can use the PDR framework to evaluate and understand interpretations, we provide numerous real-world examples. These examples highlight the often under-appreciated role played by human audiences in discussions of interpretability. Finally, based on our framework, we discuss limitations of existing methods and directions for future work. We hope that this work will provide a common vocabulary that will make it easier for both practitioners and researchers to discuss and choose from the full range of interpretation methods.},

The tidal tails are among the most remote stellar streams currently known in the Milky Way halo. Cluster members have been determined from the color-magnitude diagrams and used to establish the radial density profiles, which show, in both cases, a strong departure in the outer regions from the best-fit King profile. Spatial density maps reveal tidal tails stretching out on opposite sides of both clusters, extending over a length of ̃760 pc for Eridanus and ̃1160 pc for Palomar 15. The great circle projected from the Palomar 15 tidal tails encompasses the Galactic Center, while that for Eridanus passes close to four dwarf satellite galaxies, one of which (Sculptor) is at a comparable distance to that of Eridanus.},

  abstract = {How ground-based telescopes schedule their observations in response to different variables can significantly impact their efficiency. Namely, competing science priorities and constraints, variations in the weather, and the visibility of a particular part of the sky are some of the determining variables. In this paper we introduce the Feature-based telescope scheduler, which is an automated, decision-making algorithm. It offers controllability of the behavior, adjustability of the mission, and quick recoverability from interruptions for large ground-based telescopes. By framing the Feature-based telescope scheduler in the context of a coherent mathematical model, the functionality and performance of the algorithm are simple to interpret. Consequently, adapting this scheduler for a broad range of ground-based instruments is straightforward. This paper presents a generic version of the Feature-based scheduler, with minimal manual tailoring. We demonstrate its potential and flexibility to serve as a foundation for schedulers of the ground-based instruments. In addition, a modified version of the Feature-based scheduler for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is introduced and compared to the previous LSST schedulers.},

Most of these stars are within 1.26d of the celestial equator. We present color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for stars in two previously discovered, tidally disrupted structures. The CMDs and turnoff colors are consistent with those of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, as had been predicted. In one direction, we are even able to detect a clump of red stars, similar to that of the Sagittarius dwarf, from stars spread across 110 deg\textsuperscript{2} of sky. Focusing on stars with the colors of F turnoff objects, we identify at least five additional overdensities of stars. Four of these may be pieces of the same halo structure, which would cover a region of the sky at least 40° in diameter, at a distance of 11 kpc from the Sun (18 kpc from the center of the Galaxy). The turnoff is significantly bluer than that of thick-disk stars, yet the stars lie closer to the Galactic plane than a power-law spheroid predicts. We suggest two models to explain this new structure. One possibility is that this new structure could be a new dwarf satellite of the Milky Way, hidden in the Galactic plane and in the process of being tidally disrupted. The other possibility is that it could be part of a disklike distribution of stars which is metal-poor, with a scale height of approximately 2 kpc and a scale length of approximately 10 kpc. The fifth overdensity, which is 20 kpc away, is some distance from the Sagittarius dwarf streamer orbit and is not associated with any known Galactic structure. We have tentatively identified a sixth overdensity in the halo. If this sixth structure is instead part of a smooth distribution of halo stars (the spheroid), then the spheroid must be very flattened, with axial ratio q=0.5. It is likely that there are many smaller streams of stars in the Galactic halo.},

We propose two new relations derived from the semantic distance between subtrees, known as semantic equivalence and semantic similarity. These relations are used to guide variants of the crossover operator, resulting in two new crossover operators—semantics aware crossover (SAC) and semantic similarity-based crossover (SSC). SAC, was introduced and previously studied, is added here for the purpose of comparison and analysis. SSC extends SAC by more closely controlling the semantic distance between subtrees to which crossover may be applied. The new operators were tested on some real-valued symbolic regression problems and compared with standard crossover (SC), context aware crossover (CAC), Soft Brood Selection (SBS), and No Same Mate (NSM) selection. The experimental results show on the problems examined that, with computational effort measured by the number of function node evaluations, only SSC and SBS were significantly better than SC, and SSC was often better than SBS. Further experiments were also conducted to analyse the perfomance sensitivity to the parameter settings for SSC. This analysis leads to a conclusion that SSC is more constructive and has higher locality than SAC, NSM and SC; we believe these are the main reasons for the improved performance of SSC.},

  abstract = {We present a data-driven method for reconstructing the galactic acceleration field from phase-space (position and velocity) measurements of stellar streams. Our approach is based on a flexible and differentiable fit to the stream in phase-space, enabling a direct estimate of the acceleration vector along the stream. Reconstruction of the local acceleration field can be applied independently to each of several streams, allowing us to sample the acceleration field due to the underlying galactic potential across a range of scales. Our approach is methodologically different from previous works, as a model for the gravitational potential does not need to be adopted beforehand. Instead, our flexible neural-network-based model treats the stream as a collection of orbits with a locally similar mixture of energies, rather than assuming that the stream delineates a single stellar orbit. Accordingly, our approach allows for distinct regions of the stream to have different mean energies, as is the case for real stellar streams. Once the acceleration vector is sampled along the stream, standard analytic models for the galactic potential can then be rapidly constrained. We find our method recovers the correct parameters for a ground-truth triaxial logarithmic halo potential when applied to simulated stellar streams. Alternatively, we demonstrate that a flexible potential can be constrained with a neural network, and standard multipole expansions can also be constrained. Our approach is applicable to simple and complicated gravitational potentials alike and enables potential reconstruction from a fully data-driven standpoint using measurements of slowly phase-mixing tidal debris.},

The tails have been detected in commissioning data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, providing deep five-color photometry in a 2.5d-wide band along the equator. The stars in the tails make up a substantial part (\textasciitilde 1/3) of the current total population of cluster stars in the magnitude interval 19.5{$<$}=i*{$<$}=22.0.

This law is virtually identical to the CCM extinction law for large values of Rnu(Rnu approximately 5) but is slightly lower in the near-ultraviolet for smaller Rnu (Rnu approximately 3). The extinction law presented here agrees much better with a high-resolution extinction curve for the diffuse interstellar medium (Rnu approximately 3.1), presented by Bastiaansen (1992), than CCM. The deviations of individual extinction curves from the mean are dominated by observational errors. The wavelength resolution of this work is not high enough to show evidence for or against the existence of very broad structure in optical extinction curves.},

This increased astrometric precision presents an opportunity to find new binary stars and moving groups. We search for high-confidence comoving pairs of stars in TGAS by identifying pairs of stars consistent with having the same 3D velocity using a marginalized likelihood ratio test to discriminate candidate comoving pairs from the field population. Although we perform some visualizations using (bias-corrected) inverse parallax as a point estimate of distance, the likelihood ratio is computed with a probabilistic model that includes the covariances of parallax and proper motions and marginalizes the (unknown) true distances and 3D velocities of the stars. We find 13,085 comoving star pairs among 10,606 unique stars with separations as large as 10 pc (our search limit). Some of these pairs form larger groups through mutual comoving neighbors: many of these pair networks correspond to known open clusters and OB associations, but we also report the discovery of several new comoving groups. Most surprisingly, we find a large number of very wide (\&gt; 1 pc) separation comoving star pairs, the number of which increases with increasing separation and cannot be explained purely by false-positive contamination. Our key result is a catalog of high-confidence comoving pairs of stars in TGAS. We discuss the utility of this catalog for making dynamical inferences about the Galaxy, testing stellar atmosphere models, and validating chemical abundance measurements.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a meta-learning framework for few-shots One-Class Classification (OCC) at test-time, a setting where labeled examples are only available for the positive class, and no supervision is given for the negative example. We consider that we have a set of `one-class classification' objective-tasks with only a small set of positive examples available for each task, and a set of training tasks with full supervision (i.e. highly imbalanced classification). We propose an approach using order-equivariant networks to learn a 'meta' binary-classifier. The model will take as input an example to classify from a given task, as well as the corresponding supervised set of positive examples for this OCC task. Thus, the output of the model will be 'conditioned' on the available positive example of a given task, allowing to predict on new tasks and new examples without labeled negative examples. In this paper, we are motivated by an astronomy application. Our goal is to identify if stars belong to a specific stellar group (the 'one-class' for a given task), called \textbackslash textit\{stellar streams\}, where each stellar stream is a different OCC-task. We show that our method transfers well on unseen (test) synthetic streams, and outperforms the baselines even though it is not retrained and accesses a much smaller part of the data per task to predict (only positive supervision). We see however that it doesn't transfer as well on the real stream GD-1. This could come from intrinsic differences from the synthetic and real stream, highlighting the need for consistency in the 'nature' of the task for this method. However, light fine-tuning improve performances and outperform our baselines. Our experiments show encouraging results to further explore meta-learning methods for OCC tasks.},

  abstract = {Several lines of evidence suggest that the velocity amplitude in global simulations of solar convection, U, may be systematically over-estimated. Motivated by these recent results, we explore the factors that determine U and we consider how these might scale to solar parameter regimes. To this end, we decrease the thermal diffusivity κ along two paths in parameter space. If the kinematic viscosity ν is decreased proportionally with κ (fixing the Prandtl number P\textsubscript{r} = ν / κ), we find that U increases but asymptotes toward a constant value, as found by Featherstone and Hindman (2016). However, if ν is held fixed while decreasing κ (increasing P\textsubscript{r}), we find that U systematically decreases. We attribute this to an enhancement of the thermal content of downflow plumes, which allows them to carry the solar luminosity with slower flow speeds. We contrast this with the case of Rayleigh-Bénard convection which is not subject to this luminosity constraint. This dramatic difference in behavior for the two paths in parameter space (fixed P\textsubscript{r} or fixed ν) persists whether the heat transport by unresolved, near-surface convection is modeled as a thermal conduction or as a fixed flux. The results suggest that if solar convection can operate in a high-P\textsubscript{r} regime, then this might effectively limit the velocity amplitude. Small-scale magnetism is a possible source of enhanced viscosity that may serve to achieve this high-P\textsubscript{r} regime.},

We use a set of nearly 100 regression benchmark problems culled from open source repositories across the web. We conduct a rigorous benchmarking of four recent symbolic regression approaches as well as nine machine learning approaches from scikit-learn. The results suggest that symbolic regression performs strongly compared to state-of-the-art gradient boosting algorithms, although in terms of running times is among the slowest of the available methodologies. We discuss the results in detail and point to future research directions that may allow symbolic regression to gain wider adoption in the machine learning community.},

  abstract = {The physics of cosmic rays (CRs) is a promising candidate for explaining the driving of galactic winds and outflows. Recent galaxy formation simulations have demonstrated the need for active CR transport either in the form of diffusion or streaming to successfully launch winds in galaxies. However, due to computational limitations, most previous simulations have modeled CR transport isotropically. Here, we discuss high-resolution simulations of isolated disk galaxies in a 10\textsuperscript{11} M \textsubscript{☉} halo with the moving-mesh code Arepo that include injection of CRs from supernovae, advective transport, CR cooling, and CR transport through isotropic or anisotropic diffusion. We show that either mode of diffusion leads to the formation of strong bipolar outflows. However, they develop significantly later in the simulation with anisotropic diffusion compared to the simulation with isotropic diffusion. Moreover, we find that isotropic diffusion allows most of the CRs to quickly diffuse out of the disk, while in the simulation with anisotropic diffusion, most CRs remain in the disk once the magnetic field becomes dominated by its azimuthal component, which occurs after ̃300 Myr. This has important consequences for the gas dynamics in the disk. In particular, we show that isotropic diffusion strongly suppresses the amplification of the magnetic field in the disk compared to anisotropic or no diffusion models. We therefore conclude that reliable simulations which include CR transport inevitably need to account for anisotropic diffusion.},

  abstract = {The natural world is known to consistently abide by scientific laws that can be expressed concisely in mathematical terms, including differential equations. To understand the patterns that define these scientific laws, it is necessary to discover and solve these mathematical problems after making observations and collecting data on natural phenomena. While artificial neural networks are powerful black-box tools for automating tasks related to intelligence, the solutions we seek are related to the concise and interpretable form of symbolic mathematics.    In this work, we focus on the idea of a symbolic function learner, or SFL. A symbolic function learner can be any algorithm that is able to produce a symbolic mathematical expression that aims to optimize a given objective function. By choosing different objective functions, the SFL can be tuned to handle different learning tasks. We present a model for an SFL that is based on neural networks and can be trained using deep learning. We then use this SFL to approach the computational task of automating discovery of scientific knowledge in three ways.    We first apply our symbolic function learner as a tool for symbolic regression, a curve-fitting problem that has traditionally been approached using genetic evolution algorithms. We show that our SFL performs competitively in comparison to genetic algorithms and neural network regressors on a sample collection of regression instances. We also reframe the problem of learning differential equations as a task in symbolic regression, and use our SFL to rediscover some equations from classical physics from data.    We next present a machine-learning based method for solving differential equations symbolically. When neural networks are used to solve differential equations, they usually produce solutions in the form of black-box functions that are not directly mathematically interpretable. We introduce a method for generating symbolic expressions to solve differential equations while leveraging deep learning training methods. Unlike existing methods, our system does not require learning a language model over symbolic mathematics, making it scalable, compact, and easily adaptable for a variety of tasks and configurations. The system is designed to always return a valid symbolic formula, generating a useful approximation when an exact analytic solution to a differential equation is not or cannot be found. We demonstrate through examples the way our method can be applied on a number of differential equations that are rooted in the natural sciences, often obtaining symbolic approximations that are useful or insightful. Furthermore, we show how the system can be effortlessly generalized to find symbolic solutions to other mathematical tasks, including integration and functional equations.    We then introduce a novel method for discovering implicit relationships between variables in structured datasets in an unsupervised way. Rather than explicitly designating a causal relationship between input and output variables, our method finds mathematical relationships between variables without treating any variable as distinguished from any other. As a result, properties about the data itself can be discovered, rather than rules for predicting one variable from the others. We showcase examples of our method in the domain of geometry, demonstrating how we can re-discover famous geometric identities automatically from artificially generated data.    In total, this thesis aims to strengthen the connection between neural networks and problems in symbolic mathematics. Our proposed SFL is the main tool that we show can be applied to a variety of tasks, including but not limited to symbolic regression. We show how using this approach to symbolic function learning paves the way for future developments in automated scientific knowledge discovery.},

  abstract = {We present a Bayesian graph neural network (BGNN) that can estimate the weak lensing convergence (\$\textbackslash kappa\$) from photometric measurements of galaxies along a given line of sight. The method is of particular interest in strong gravitational time delay cosmography (TDC), where characterizing the "external convergence" (\$\textbackslash kappa\_\{\textbackslash rm ext\}\$) from the lens environment and line of sight is necessary for precise inference of the Hubble constant (\$H\_0\$). Starting from a large-scale simulation with a \$\textbackslash kappa\$ resolution of \$\textbackslash sim\$1\$'\$, we introduce fluctuations on galaxy-galaxy lensing scales of \$\textbackslash sim\$1\$''\$ and extract random sightlines to train our BGNN. We then evaluate the model on test sets with varying degrees of overlap with the training distribution. For each test set of 1,000 sightlines, the BGNN infers the individual \$\textbackslash kappa\$ posteriors, which we combine in a hierarchical Bayesian model to yield constraints on the hyperparameters governing the population. For a test field well sampled by the training set, the BGNN recovers the population mean of \$\textbackslash kappa\$ precisely and without bias, resulting in a contribution to the \$H\_0\$ error budget well under 1\textbackslash\%. In the tails of the training set with sparse samples, the BGNN, which can ingest all available information about each sightline, extracts more \$\textbackslash kappa\$ signal compared to a simplified version of the traditional method based on matching galaxy number counts, which is limited by sample variance. Our hierarchical inference pipeline using BGNNs promises to improve the \$\textbackslash kappa\_\{\textbackslash rm ext\}\$ characterization for precision TDC. The implementation of our pipeline is available as a public Python package, Node to Joy.},

  abstract = {Understanding the geometry of neural network loss surfaces is important for the development of improved optimization algorithms and for building a theoretical understanding of why deep learning works. In this paper, we study the geometry in terms of the distribution of eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at critical points of varying energy. We introduce an analytical framework and a set of tools from random matrix theory that allow us to compute an approximation of this distribution under a set of simplifying assumptions. The shape of the spectrum depends strongly on the energy and another key parameter, φ, which measures the ratio of parameters to data points. Our analysis predicts and numerical simulations support that for critical points of small index, the number of negative eigenvalues scales like the 3/2 power of the energy. We leave as an open problem an explanation for our observation that, in the context of a certain memorization task, the energy of minimizers is well-approximated by the function 1 2 (1 − φ)2.},

This is the problem of \$\textbackslash textit\{symbolic regression\}\$. Despite recent advances in training neural networks to solve complex tasks, deep learning approaches to symbolic regression are underexplored. We propose a framework that leverages deep learning for symbolic regression via a simple idea: use a large model to search the space of small models. Specifically, we use a recurrent neural network to emit a distribution over tractable mathematical expressions and employ a novel risk-seeking policy gradient to train the network to generate better-fitting expressions. Our algorithm outperforms several baseline methods (including Eureqa, the gold standard for symbolic regression) in its ability to exactly recover symbolic expressions on a series of benchmark problems, both with and without added noise. More broadly, our contributions include a framework that can be applied to optimize hierarchical, variable-length objects under a black-box performance metric, with the ability to incorporate constraints in situ, and a risk-seeking policy gradient formulation that optimizes for best-case performance instead of expected performance.},

Exact wavefunctions of interesting chemical systems are out of reach because they are NP-hard to compute in general, but approximations can be found using polynomially-scaling algorithms. The key challenge for many of these algorithms is the choice of wavefunction approximation, or Ansatz, which must trade off between efficiency and accuracy. Neural networks have shown impressive power as accurate practical function approximators and promise as a compact wavefunction Ansatz for spin systems, but problems in electronic structure require wavefunctions that obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. Here we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, the Fermionic Neural Network, as a powerful wavefunction Ansatz for many-electron systems. The Fermionic Neural Network is able to achieve accuracy beyond other variational quantum Monte Carlo Ans\textbackslash "atze on a variety of atoms and small molecules. Using no data other than atomic positions and charges, we predict the dissociation curves of the nitrogen molecule and hydrogen chain, two challenging strongly-correlated systems, to significantly higher accuracy than the coupled cluster method, widely considered the most accurate scalable method for quantum chemistry at equilibrium geometry. This demonstrates that deep neural networks can improve the accuracy of variational quantum Monte Carlo to the point where it outperforms other ab-initio quantum chemistry methods, opening the possibility of accurate direct optimization of wavefunctions for previously intractable many-electron systems.},

  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to partially complementary regions within the 3’UTR of their target genes. Computational methods play an important role in target prediction and assume that the miRNA "seed region" (nt 2 to 8) is required for functional targeting, but typically only identify 80\% of known bindings. Recent studies have highlighted a role for the entire miRNA, suggesting that a more flexible methodology is needed. We present a novel approach for miRNA target prediction based on Deep Learning (DL) which, rather than incorporating any knowledge (such as seed regions), investigates the entire miRNA and 3’UTR mRNA nucleotides to learn a uninhibited set of feature descriptors related to the targeting process. We collected more than 150,000 experimentally validated homo sapiens miRNA:gene targets and cross referenced them with different CLIP-Seq, CLASH and iPAR-CLIP datasets to obtain 20,000 validated miRNA:gene exact target sites. Using this data, we implemented and trained a deep neural network - composed of autoencoders and a feed-forward network - able to automatically learn features describing miRNA-mRNA interactions and assess functionality. Predictions were then refined using information such as site location or site accessibility energy. In a comparison using independent datasets, our DL approach consistently outperformed existing prediction methods, recognizing the seed region as a common feature in the targeting process, but also identifying the role of pairings outside this region. Thermodynamic analysis also suggests that site accessibility plays a role in targeting but that it cannot be used as a sole indicator for functionality.},

The general form of an effective-viscosity formulation is shown to be a finite tensor polynomial. For two-dimensional flows, the coefficients of this polynomial are evaluated from the modelled Reynolds-stress equations of Launder, Reece \& Rodi (1975). The advantage of the proposed effective-viscosity formulation, equation (4.3), over isotropie-viscosity hypotheses is that the whole velocity-gradient tensor affects the predicted Reynolds stresses. Two notable consequences of this are that (i) the complete Reynolds-stress tensor is realistically modelled and (ii) the influence of streamline curvature on the Reynolds stresses is incorporated.},

  abstract = {Collective behaviors are typically hard to model. The scale of the swarm, the large number of interactions, and the richness and complexity of the behaviors are factors that make it difficult to distill a collective behavior into simple symbolic expressions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to symbolic regression designed to facilitate such modeling. Using raw and post-processed data as an input, our approach produces viable symbolic expressions that closely model the target behavior. Our approach is composed of two phases. In the first, a graph neural network (GNN) is trained to extract an approximation of the target behavior. In the second phase, the GNN is used to produce data for a nested evolutionary algorithm called macro-micro evolution (MME). The macro layer of this algorithm selects candidate symbolic expressions, while the micro layer tunes its parameters. Experimental evaluation shows that our approach outperforms competing solutions for symbolic regression, making it possible to extract compact expressions for complex swarm behaviors.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the interpretable models from real gasification datasets of the project “Centre for Energy and Environmental Technologies” (CEET) discovered by symbolic regression. To evaluate CEET models based on input data, two different statistical metrics to quantify their accuracy are usually used: Mean Square Error (MSE) and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). However, if the testing points and the points used to construct the models are not chosen randomly from the continuum of the input variable, but instead from the limited number of discrete input points, the behavior of the model between such points very possibly will not fit well the physical essence of the modelled phenomenon. For example, the developed model can have unexpected oscillatory tendencies between the used points, while the usually used statistical metrics cannot detect these anomalies. However, using dynamic system criteria in addition to statistical metrics, such suspicious models that do fit well-expected behavior can be automatically detected and abandoned. This communication will show the universal method based on dynamic system criteria which can detect suitable models among all those which have good properties following statistical metrics. The dynamic system criteria measure the complexity of the candidate models using approximate and sample entropy. The examples are given for waste gasification where the output data (percentage of each particular gas in the produced mixture) is given only for six values of the input data (temperature in the chamber in which the process takes place). In such cases instead, to produce expected simple spline-like curves, artificial intelligence tools can produce inappropriate oscillatory curves with sharp picks due to the known tendency of symbolic regression to produce overfitted and relatively more complex models if the nature of the physical model is simple.},

  abstract = {We consider an expanding Friedmann cosmology containing a "gas" of self-gravitating masses. The masses condense into aggregates which (when sufficiently bound) we identify as single particles of a larger mass. We propose that after this process has proceeded through several scales, the mass spectrum of condensations becomes "self-similar" and independent of the spectrum initially assumed. Some details of the self-similar distribution, and its evolution in time, can be calculated with the linear perturbation theory. Unlike other authors, we make no ad hoc assumptions about the spectrum of long-wavelength initial perturbatidns: the nonlinear N-body interactions of the mass points randomize their positions and generate a perturbation to all larger scales; this should fix the self-similar distribution almost uniquely. The results of numerical experiments on 1000 bodies are presented; these appear to show new nonlinear effects: condensations can "bootstrap" their way up in size faster than the linear theory predicts. Our self-similar model predicts relations between the masses and radii of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, as well as their mass spectra. We compare the predictions with available data, and find some rather striking agreements. If the model is to explain galaxies, then isothermal "seed" masses of 3 x 1 0 M0 must have existed at recombination. To explain clusters of galaxies, the only necessary seeds are the galaxies themselves. The size of clusters determines, in principle, the deceleration parameter q0 presently available data give only very broad limits, unfortunately.

Using data from the Gaia second data release combined with Pan-STARRS photometry, we present a sample of highly probable members of the longest cold stream in the Milky Way, GD-1. The resulting map of GD-1: (1) extends the apparent length of the stream by 20°, (2) reveals plausible locations for the progenitor, (3) detects high-contrast gaps along the stream, and (4) indicates the existence of stream members perturbed off the main stream track. These discoveries are only possible because of the exquisite astrometry from Gaia, which permits a clean separation of the stream from Milky Way stars. The additional length and a proper treatment of the progenitor will aid in dynamical modeling of GD-1 for mapping the large-scale dark matter distribution. The complex morphology of the stream points to a turbulent history; detailed phase-space properties of the perturbed stream members could potentially constrain dark matter substructure in the Milky Way.},

Galactic CR are produced together with hot gas by sources deep in the disk. This leads to a galactic wind and magnetohydrodynamic fluctuations (excited by the cosmic-ray streaming instability) which in turn together determine the transport of these energetic particles into intergalactic space. Wave excitation is balanced locally by nonlinear Landau damping. The cosmic-ray transport equations for the dominant nucleons are solved in an approximate form analytically. Although fully nonlinear, the resulting picture is simple and corresponds to an overall spatial structure that extends to distances considerably greater than the radius of the galactic disk. The inferred source spectrum for cosmic-ray nucleons is a rather hard power law in energy, of index \textasciitilde 2.1. The observed abundances of secondary nuclei are also consistent with this model. The observed disk-halo transition at distances \textasciitilde 1kpc is an important part of the detailed picture in wich ion neutral friction damps short-scale magnetic fluctuations below that level.},

  abstract = {We study the orbital architecture of multi-planet systems detected by the Kepler transit mission using N-body simulations, focusing on the orbital spacing between adjacent planets in systems showing four or more transiting planets. We find that the observed spacings are tightly clustered around 12 mutual Hill radii, when transit geometry and sensitivity limits are accounted for. In comparison, dynamical integrations reveal that the minimum spacing required for systems of similar masses to survive dynamical instability for as long as 1 billion yr is ∼10 if all orbits are circular and coplanar and ∼12 if planetary orbits have eccentricities of ∼0.02 (a value suggested by studies of planet transit-time variations). This apparent coincidence, between the observed spacing and the theoretical stability threshold, leads us to propose that typical planetary systems were formed with even tighter spacing, but most, except for the widest ones, have undergone dynamical instability, and are pared down to a more anemic version of their former selves, with fewer planets and larger spacings. So while the high-multiple systems (five or more transiting planets) are primordial systems that remain stable, the single or double planetary systems, abundantly discovered by the Kepler mission, may be the descendants of more closely packed high-multiple systems. If this hypothesis is correct, we infer that the formation environment of Kepler systems should be more dissipative than that of the terrestrial planets.},

  abstract = {The escape of cosmic rays from the Galaxy leads to a gradient in the cosmic ray pressure that acts as a force on the background plasma, in the direction opposite to the gravitational pull. If this force is large enough to win against gravity, a wind can be launched that removes gas from the Galaxy, thereby regulating several physical processes, including star formation. The dynamics of these cosmic ray driven winds is intrinsically non-linear in that the spectrum of cosmic rays determines the characteristics of the wind (velocity, pressure, magnetic field) and in turn the wind dynamics affects the cosmic ray spectrum. Moreover, the gradient of the cosmic ray distribution function causes excitation of Alfvén waves, that in turn determines the scattering properties of cosmic rays, namely their diffusive transport. These effects all feed into each other so that what we see at the Earth is the result of these non-linear effects. Here, we investigate the launch and evolution of such winds, and we determine the implications for the spectrum of cosmic rays by solving together the hydrodynamical equations for the wind and the transport equation for cosmic rays under the action of self-generated diffusion and advection with the wind and the self-excited Alfvén waves.},

We present a model for the chemical evolution of fluorine in the Milky Way using a semi-analytic multizone chemical evolution model. For the first time, we demonstrate quantitatively the impact of fluorine nucleosynthesis in Wolf-Rayet and AGB stars. The inclusion of these latter two fluorine production sites provides a possible solution to the long-standing discrepancy between model predictions and the fluorine abundances observed in Milky Way giants. Finally, fluorine is discussed as a possible probe of the role of supernovae and intermediate-mass stars in the chemical evolution history of the globular cluster ω Centauri.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} The second \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} data release is based on 22 months of mission data with an average of 0.9 billion individual CCD observations per day. A data volume of this size and granularity requires a robust and reliable but still flexible system to achieve the demanding accuracy and precision constraints that \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} is capable of delivering.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} We aim to describe the input data, the treatment of blue photometer/red photometer (BP/RP) low-resolution spectra required to produce the integrated \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{BP{$<$}sub/{$>$} and \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{RP{$<$}sub/{$>$} fluxes, the process used to establish the internal \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} photometric system, and finally, the generation of the mean source photometry from the calibrated epoch data for \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} The internal \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} photometric system was initialised using an iterative process that is solely based on \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} data. A set of calibrations was derived for the entire \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 baseline and then used to produce the final mean source photometry. The photometric catalogue contains 2.5 billion sources comprised of three different grades depending on the availability of colour information and the procedure used to calibrate them: 1.5 billion gold, 144 million silver, and 0.9 billion bronze. These figures reflect the results of the photometric processing; the content of the data release will be different due to the validation and data quality filters applied during the catalogue preparation. The photometric processing pipeline, PhotPipe, implements all the processing and calibration workflows in terms of Map/Reduce jobs based on the Hadoop platform. This is the first example of a processing system for a large astrophysical survey project to make use of these technologies.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} The improvements in the generation of the integrated \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}–band fluxes, in the attitude modelling, in the cross-matching, and and in the identification of spurious detections led to a much cleaner input stream for the photometric processing. This, combined with the improvements in the definition of the internal photometric system and calibration flow, produced high-quality photometry. Hadoop proved to be an excellent platform choice for the implementation of PhotPipe in terms of overall performance, scalability, downtime, and manpower required for operations and maintenance.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

These include all suitable SNe Ia in the last 40 years at z{$<$}0.01, measured with {$>$}1000 orbits, more than doubling the sample whose size limits the precision of H0. The Cepheids are calibrated geometrically from Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, masers in N4258 (here tripling that Cepheid sample), and DEBs in the LMC. The Cepheids were measured with the same WFC3 instrument and filters (F555W, F814W, F160W) to negate zeropoint errors. We present multiple verifications of Cepheid photometry and tests of background determinations that show measurements are accurate in the presence of crowding. The SNe calibrate the mag-z relation from the new Pantheon+ compilation, accounting here for covariance between all SN data, with host properties and SN surveys matched to negate differences. We decrease the uncertainty in H0 to 1 km/s/Mpc with systematics. We present a comprehensive set of \textasciitilde 70 analysis variants to explore the sensitivity of H0 to selections of anchors, SN surveys, z range, variations in the analysis of dust, metallicity, form of the P-L relation, SN color, flows, sample bifurcations, and simultaneous measurement of H(z). Our baseline result from the Cepheid-SN sample is H0=73.04+-1.04 km/s/Mpc, which includes systematics and lies near the median of all analysis variants. We demonstrate consistency with measures from HST of the TRGB between SN hosts and NGC 4258 with Cepheids and together these yield 72.53+-0.99. Including high-z SN Ia we find H0=73.30+-1.04 with q0=-0.51+-0.024. We find a 5-sigma difference with H0 predicted by Planck+LCDM, with no indication this arises from measurement errors or analysis variations considered to date. The source of this now long-standing discrepancy between direct and cosmological routes to determining the Hubble constant remains unknown.},

We first demonstrate the merit of this method on illustrative experiments and then analyze four parameters of the latest LIGO/Virgo data release: primary mass, secondary mass, redshift, and effective spin. Our results show that despite the small and notoriously noisy dataset, the posterior predictive distributions (assuming a prior over the parameters of the flow) of the observed gravitational wave population recover structure that agrees with robust previous phenomenological modeling results while being less susceptible to biases introduced by less flexible models. Therefore, the method forms a promising flexible, reliable replacement for population inference distributions, even when data is highly noisy.},

This is mainly due to their ability to combine the expressiveness of traditional explanations from textbooks, with the interaction capabilities of software applications, which provides numerous benefits for both students and lecturers of different fields. One of the areas that could benefit from their adoption is such of mobile robotics, whose recent popularity has resulted in an increasing demand of trained practitioners with a solid theoretical and practical background. Therefore, there is a need of high quality learning materials adapted to modern tools and methodologies. With that in mind, this work explores how the introduction of Jupyter notebooks in undergraduate mobile robotic courses contributes to improve both teaching and learning experiences. For that, we first present a series of (publicly available) educational notebooks encompassing a variety of topics relevant for robotics, with a particular emphasis in the study of mobile robots and commonly used sensors. Those documents have been built from the ground up to take advantage of the Jupyter Notebook framework, bridging the typical gap between theoretical frame and interactive code. We also present a case study describing the notebooks usage in undergraduate courses at University of Málaga, including a discussion on the promising results and findings obtained.},

  abstract = {Galactic outflows play an important role in galactic evolution. Despite their importance, a detailed understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for the driving of these winds is lacking. In an effort to gain more insight into the nature of these flows, we perform global three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of an isolated Milky Way-size starburst galaxy. We focus on the dynamical role of cosmic rays (CRs) injected by supernovae, and specifically on the impact of the streaming and anisotropic diffusion of CRs along the magnetic fields. We find that these microphysical effects can have a significant effect on the wind launching and mass loading factors, depending on the details of the plasma physics. Due to the CR streaming instability, CRs propagating in the interstellar medium scatter on self-excited Alfvén waves and couple to the gas. When the wave growth due to the streaming instability is inhibited by some damping process, such as turbulent damping, the coupling of CRs to the gas is weaker and their effective propagation speed faster than the Alfvén speed. Alternatively, CRs could scatter from “extrinsic turbulence” that is driven by another mechanism. We demonstrate that the presence of moderately super-Alfvénic CR streaming enhances the efficiency of galactic wind driving. Cosmic rays stream away from denser regions near the galactic disk along partially ordered magnetic fields and in the process accelerate more tenuous gas away from the galaxy. For CR acceleration efficiencies broadly consistent with the observational constraints, CRs reduce the galactic star formation rates and significantly aid in launching galactic winds.},

In contrast to ordinary black-box regression, this approach allows understanding functional relations and generalizing them from observed data to unseen parts of the parameter space. We show how to extend the class of learnable equations for a recently proposed equation learning network to include divisions, and we improve the learning and model selection strategy to be useful for challenging real-world data. For systems governed by analytical expressions, our method can in many cases identify the true underlying equation and extrapolate to unseen domains. We demonstrate its effectiveness by experiments on a cart-pendulum system, where only 2 random rollouts are required to learn the forward dynamics and successfully achieve the swing-up task.},

We compare the learned model to specialized PDE solvers in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, numerical stability, and generalization performance. We find that the learned models outperform coarsened solvers on certain metrics, particularly in their ability to preserve high-frequency information at low resolution, and describe ways to improve generalization beyond the training distribution. To our knowledge, our model is the first to be trained on Athena++ (a state-of-the-art simulator widely used in computational fluid dynamics and magneto-hydrodynamics), and more generally, the first fully-learned astrophysical turbulence simulator.},

  abstract = {[Abridged] With Gaia Data Release 2, the astronomical community enters a new era of multidimensional surveys of the Milky Way. This new phase-space view of our Galaxy demands new tools for comparing observations to simulations of Milky-Way-mass galaxies in a cosmological context, to test the physics of both dark matter and galaxy formation. We present ananke, a framework for generating synthetic phase-space surveys from high-resolution baryonic simulations, and use it to create a suite of synthetic surveys designed to resemble Gaia DR2 in data structure, magnitude limits, and observational errors. We use three cosmological simulations of Milky-Way-mass galaxies from the Latte suite of the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project, which offer many advantages for generating synthetic stellar surveys: self-consistent clustering of star formation in dense molecular clouds, thin stellar and gaseous disks, cosmological accretion and enrichment histories, all in live cosmological halos with satellite dwarf galaxies and stellar halos. We select 3 solar viewpoints from each simulation for a total of 9 synthetic surveys. We generate synthetic stars assuming that each simulation's star particles represent single stellar populations, and distribute synthetic stars in position and velocity using superimposed kernels for different populations. At each viewpoint, we compute a self-consistent dust extinction map from the gas metallicity distribution in each simulation and apply a simple error model to produce a synthetic Gaia-like survey. This results in a catalog of synthetic stars, as if measured by Gaia, that includes both observational properties and a pointer to the generating star particle. We also provide the complete \$z = 0\$ snapshot--star, gas, and dark matter particles--for each simulated galaxy. We describe data access points, the data model, and plans for future upgrades.},

Previous research has shown that partitioning an evolving population into age groups can greatly improve the ability to identify global optima and avoid converging to local optima. Here, we propose that treating age as an explicit optimization criterion can increase performance even further, with fewer algorithm implementation parameters. The proposed method evolves a population on the two-dimensional Pareto front comprising (a) how long the genotype has been in the population (age); and (b) its performance (fitness). We compare this approach with previous approaches on the Symbolic Regression problem, sweeping the problem difficulty over a range of solution complexities and number of variables. Our results indicate that the multi-objective approach identifies the exact target solution more often that the age-layered population and standard population methods. The multi-objective method also performs better on higher complexity problems and higher dimensional datasets -- finding global optima with less computational effort.},

Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the “alphabet” used to describe those systems. An algorithm has been developed to search for natural laws of physics in large data sets. An algorithm has been developed to search for natural laws of physics in large data sets.},

  abstract = {Numerical calculations have been carried out which cover the first 4 million years of those evolution phases in which helium burning occurs in a shell in a star of 1 solar mass and of a Population II composition. The thermal instability previously found to occur in these helium-shell-burning phases leads to relaxation oscillations-just as has already been shown by other authors for other types of stars. Thirteen consecutive relaxation cycles are covered by the present computations. In each cycle the main helium- shell flash causes a convective xone to stretch outward from the helium shell. In the initial relaxation cycles this convection xone does not reach the hydrogen-containing layers. However, cycle after cycle the main helium-shell flash increases in strength and, in consequence, causes a larger and larger convection xone. Mter about nine cycles the convection xone finally reaches the hydrogen-containing layers and from then on, for a short while in each cycle, hydrogen is mixed into the hot carbon-rich interior.

We train neural networks using data from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project and show that the model can predict the total mass of a subhalo with high accuracy: more than 99\% of the subhalos have a predicted mass within 0.2 dex of their true value. The networks exhibit surprising extrapolation properties, being able to accurately predict the total mass of any type of subhalo containing any kind of galaxy at any redshift from simulations with different cosmologies, astrophysics models, subgrid physics, volumes, and resolutions, indicating that the network may have found a universal relation. We then use different methods to find equations that approximate the relation found by the networks and derive new analytic expressions that predict the total mass of a subhalo from its radius, velocity dispersion, and maximum circular velocity. We show that in some regimes, the analytic expressions are more accurate than the neural networks. We interpret the relation found by the neural network and approximated by the analytic equation as being connected to the virial theorem.},

  abstract = {We describe a density-based hierarchical group finding algorithm capable of identifying structures and substructures of any shape and density in multidimensional data sets where each dimension can be a numeric attribute with arbitrary measurement scale. This has applications in a wide variety of fields from finding structures in galaxy redshift surveys, to identifying halos and subhalos in N-body simulations and group finding in Local Group chemodynamical data sets. In general, clustering schemes require an a priori definition of a metric (a non-negative function that gives the distance between two points in a space) and the quality of clustering depends upon this choice. The general practice is to use a constant global metric which is optimal only if the clusters in the data are self-similar. For complex data configurations even the most finely tuned constant global metric turns out to be suboptimal. Moreover, the correct choice of metric also becomes increasingly important as the number of dimensions increase. To address these problems, we present an entropy-based binary space partitioning algorithm which uses a locally adaptive metric for each data point. The metric is employed to calculate the density at each point and a list of its nearest neighbors, and this information is then used to form a hierarchy of groups. Finally, the ratio of maximum to minimum density of points in a group is used to estimate the significance of the groups. Setting a threshold on this significance can effectively screen out groups arising due to Poisson noise and helps organize the groups into meaningful clusters. For a data set of N points, the algorithm requires only O(N) space and O(N(log N)3) time which makes it ideally suitable for analyzing large data sets. As an example, we apply the algorithm to identify structures in a simulated stellar halo using the full six-dimensional phase space coordinates.},

  abstract = {We study gaseous outflows from disk galaxies driven by the combined effects of ram pressure on cold gas clouds and radiation pressure on dust grains. Taking into account the gravity due to disk, bulge, and dark matter halo, and assuming continuous star formation in the disk, we show that radiation or ram pressure alone is not sufficient to drive escaping winds from disk galaxies and that both processes contribute. We show that in the parameter space of star formation rate (SFR) and rotation speed of galaxies the wind speed in galaxies with rotation speeds v\textsubscript{c} \&lt;= 200 km s\textsuperscript{-1} and SFR \&lt;= 100 M \textsubscript{☉} yr\textsuperscript{-1} has a larger contribution from ram pressure, and that in high-mass galaxies with large SFR radiation from the disk has a greater role in driving galactic winds. The ratio of wind speed to circular speed can be approximated as \{v\_w / v\_c\} \textbackslash sim 10\^\{0.7\} \textbackslash, [SFR/ 50 \textbackslash, \{M\_\{\textbackslash odot \} \textbackslash,yr\^\{-1\}\}] \^\{0.4\} \textbackslash{} [\{v\_c/ 120\textbackslash, km\textbackslash,s\^\{-1\}\}]\^ \{-1.25\}. We show that this conclusion is borne out by observations of galactic winds at low and high redshift and also of circumgalactic gas. We also estimate the mass loading factors under the combined effect of ram and radiation pressure, and show that the ratio of mass-loss rate to SFR scales roughly as v \textsuperscript{-1} \textsubscript{ c }Σ\textsubscript{ g } \textsuperscript{-1}, where Σ\textsubscript{ g } is the gas column density in the disk.},

Very few previous studies have examined this crucial and challenging weather forecasting problem from the machine learning perspective. In this paper, we formulate precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem in which both the input and the prediction target are spatiotemporal sequences. By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting problem. Experiments show that our ConvLSTM network captures spatiotemporal correlations better and consistently outperforms FC-LSTM and the state-of-the-art operational ROVER algorithm for precipitation nowcasting.},

In this work, we generalize the convolution operator from regular grids to arbitrary graphs while avoiding the spectral domain, which allows us to handle graphs of varying size and connectivity. To move beyond a simple diffusion, filter weights are conditioned on the specific edge labels in the neighborhood of a vertex. Together with the proper choice of graph coarsening, we explore constructing deep neural networks for graph classification. In particular, we demonstrate the generality of our formulation in point cloud classification, where we set the new state of the art, and on a graph classification dataset, where we outperform other deep learning approaches.

  abstract = {Abstract An extended period numerical integration of a baroclinic primitive equation model has been made for the simulation and the study of the dynamics of the atmosphere's general circulation. The solution corresponding to external gravitational propagation is filtered by requiring the vertically integrated divergence to vanish identically. The vertical structure permits as dependent variables the horizontal wind at two internal levels and a single temperature, with the static stability entering as a parameter. The incoming radiation is a function of latitude only corresponding to the annual mean, and the outgoing radiation is taken to be a function of the local temperature. With the requirement for thermal equilibrium, the domain mean temperature is specified as a parameter. The role of condensation is taken into account only as it effectively reduces the static stability. All other external sources and sinks of heat are assumed to balance each other locally, and are thus omitted. The kinematics are that of a fluid on a sphere bounded by smooth zonal walls at the equator and at approximately 64° latitude. The dissipative sinks are provided by: (a) surface stresses proportional through a drag coefficient to the square of the surface wind which is suitably extrapolated from above, (b) internal convective stresses proportional to the vertical wind shear, and (c) lateral diffusion of momentum and heat through an exchange coefficient which depends on the local horizontal rate of strain—a horizontal length scale entering as the governing parameter. For a given specification of the parameters, an integration for 60 days has been made from initial conditions where random temperature disturbances have been superimposed on a zonally symmetric regime which is baroclinically unstable according to linear theory. This experiment not only displays the scale selective character of baroclinic instability, yielding zonal wave number 5 to 6, but also predicts an index or energy cycle. The period of this cycle is 11 to 12 days for the first 40 days of the experiment, then lengthening to 17 days while diminishing in amplitude during the latter part. The resulting mean zonal velocity profile is in good qualitative agreement with observation, but too intense, presumably because the effective static stability parameter is taken too large. Furthermore this profile is found to be no more than 5 percent super-geostrophic poleward of the angular momentum maximum and no more than 2 percent sub-geostrophic equatorward. The total zonal angular momentum remains constant to within 2 percent irrespective of the phase of the index cycle. This balance is controlled by the surface wind distribution which agrees quite well with observation. The poleward transport is mainly accomplished by the large-scale eddies, whereas the internal vertical flux is predominantly a transfer of the earth's angular momentum by the meridional circulation. The poleward heat transport is primarily accomplished by a Hadley circulation at low latitudes but by the large-scale horizontal eddies in mid-latitudes, where a Ferrel circulation tends to compensate through an equatorward flux. This compensation at mid-latitudes by an indirect meridional circulation is also quite evident, in the potential-kinetic energy transformations. Comparison of the momentum and heat transfer with observed data when available shows reasonably good quantitative agreement. The lateral transfer of momentum and heat by the non-linear diffusion, which parametrically is supposed to simulate the action of motions of sub-grid scale, accounts for a significant portion of the total eddy transfer. Although no direct comparison with the corresponding transfer in the real atmosphere is available, intuitively our small-scale diffusion appears to play too large a role. A diagnosis is made of the transformations among the baratropic and baroclinic parts of the kinetic energy as well as the zonal mean and zonal perturbation parts of the available potential and kinetic energy. This reveals the dominant paths that the energy passes through from source to ultimate sinks and the processes responsible for these transformations. It is found that the partitioning of dissipation by the energy components may differ considerably from estimates made from observation.},

Two of the primary problems with industrial use of symbolic regression are (1) the relatively large computational demands in comparison with other nonlinear empirical modeling techniques such as neural networks and (2) the difficulty in making the trade-off between expression accuracy and complexity. The latter issue is significant since, in general, we prefer parsimonious (simple) expressions with the expectation that they are more robust with respect to changes over time in the underlying system or extrapolation outside the range of the data used as the reference in evolving the symbolic regression.},

Curriculum learning strategies have been successfully employed in all areas of machine learning, in a wide range of tasks. However, the necessity of finding a way to rank the samples from easy to hard, as well as the right pacing function for introducing more difficult data can limit the usage of the curriculum approaches. In this survey, we show how these limits have been tackled in the literature, and we present different curriculum learning instantiations for various tasks in machine learning. We construct a multi-perspective taxonomy of curriculum learning approaches by hand, considering various classification criteria. We further build a hierarchical tree of curriculum learning methods using an agglomerative clustering algorithm, linking the discovered clusters with our taxonomy. At the end, we provide some interesting directions for future work.},

  abstract = {We use genetic programming (GP), a variant of evolutionary computation, to build interpretable models of global mean temperature as a function of natural and anthropogenic forcings. In contrast to the conventional approach, which engages models that are physically-based but very data-demanding and computation-intense, the proposed method is a data-driven randomized search algorithm capable of inducing a model from moderate amount of training data at reasonable computational cost. GP maintains a population of models and recombines them iteratively to improve their performance meant as an ability to explain the training data. Each model is a multiple input–single output arithmetic expression built of a predefined set of elementary components. Inputs include external climate forcings, such as solar activity, volcanic eruptions, composition of the atmosphere (greenhouse gas concentration and aerosols), and indices of internal variability (oscillations in the Ocean-Atmosphere system), while the output is the large-scale temperature. We used the data from the period 1900–1999 for training and the period 2000–2009 for testing, and employed two quality measures: mean absolute error and correlation coefficient. The experiment showed that the models evolved by GP are capable to predict, based exclusively on non-temperature data, the global temperature more accurately than a reference approach known in the literature.},

  abstract = {Machine learning is a powerful way to learn effective dynamics of physical simulations, and has seen great interest from the community in recent years. Recent work has shown that deep neural networks trained in an end-to-end manner seem capable of learning to predict turbulent dynamics on coarse grids more accurately than classical solvers. All these works point out that adding Gaussian noise to the input during training is indispensable to improve the stability and roll-out performance of learned simulators, as an alternative to training through multiple steps. In this work we bring in insights from robust machine learning and propose to inject adversarial noise to move machine learning systems a step further towards improving generalization in ML-assisted physical simulations. We advocate that training our models on these worst case perturbation instead of model-agnostic Gaussian noise might lead to better rollout and hope that adversarial noise injection becomes a standard tool for ML-based simulations. We show experimentally in the 2D-setting that for certain classes of turbulence adversarial noise can help stabilize model rollouts, maintain a lower loss and preserve other physical properties such as energy. In addition, we identify a potentially more challenging task, driven 2D-turbulence and show that while none of the noise-based attempts significantly improve rollout, adversarial noise helps.},

While their expressiveness is the reason they succeed, it also causes them to learn uninterpretable solutions that could have counter-intuitive properties. In this paper we report two such properties. First, we find that there is no distinction between individual high level units and random linear combinations of high level units, according to various methods of unit analysis. It suggests that it is the space, rather than the individual units, that contains of the semantic information in the high layers of neural networks. Second, we find that deep neural networks learn input-output mappings that are fairly discontinuous to a significant extend. We can cause the network to misclassify an image by applying a certain imperceptible perturbation, which is found by maximizing the network's prediction error. In addition, the specific nature of these perturbations is not a random artifact of learning: the same perturbation can cause a different network, that was trained on a different subset of the dataset, to misclassify the same input.},

As a result, they have been unable to anticipate an increasing number of undesirable long-term consequences of their proposed rankings, from fueling the spread of misinformation and increasing polarization to degrading social discourse. Can we design ranking models that anticipate the consequences of their proposed rankings and are able to avoid the undesirable ones? In this paper, we first introduce a joint representation of rankings and user dynamics using Markov decision processes. Then, we show that this representation greatly simplifies the construction of consequential ranking models that trade off theimmediate utility and the long-term welfare. In particular, we can obtain optimal consequential rankings by applying weighted sampling on the rankings provided by models that maximize measures of immediate utility. However, in practice, such a strategy may be inefficient and impractical, specially in high dimensional scenarios. To overcome this, we introduce an efficient gradient-based algorithm to learn parameterized consequential ranking models that effectively approximate optimal ones. We illustrate our methodology using synthetic and real data gathered from Reddit and show that our consequential rankings may mitigate the spread of misinformation and improve the civility of online discussions.},

  abstract = {In the last few years, there has been significant progress in elucidating the dynamics that can drive instabilities in compact planetary systems with low mutual inclinations. A long-standing numerical result is that instabilities in two-planet systems are a special case, compared with general systems with three or more planets. The edge of stability for two eccentric planets was recently analytically understood as the boundary where mean motion resonances (MMRs) overlap, but this criterion fails in general for higher multiplicity systems. We show that in the general compact, multi-planet case, the chaotic boundary can still be understood through MMR overlap, but only if one additionally accounts for the long-term secular evolution, which causes MMRs to slowly expand and contract, and modulates the boundary at which they overlap with one another. We demonstrate that for closely spaced two-planet systems, a near-symmetry strongly suppresses this secular modulation, explaining why the chaotic boundaries for two-planet systems are qualitatively different from cases with more than two planets. Finally, I will demonstrate how the community can evaluate our semi-analytic chaotic boundary with the open-source Stability of Planetary Orbital Configurations Klassifier (SPOCK) package, in order to help constrain and understand new multiplanet system discoveries.},

The methods take advantage of prior knowledge of population demography, in addition to the molecular data. While some theoretical results are presented, a central focus is on computational methods. These methods are easy to implement, and, since explicit formulae tend to be either unavailable or unilluminating, they are also more useful and more informative in most applications. Extensions are presented that allow for the effects of uncertainty in our knowledge of population size and mutation rates, for variability in population sizes, for regions of different mutation rate, and for inference concerning the coalescence time of the entire population. The methods are illustrated using recent data from the human Y chromosome.},

  abstract = {When surrounded by a transparent emission region, black holes are expected to reveal a dark shadow caused by gravitational light bending and photon capture at the event horizon. To image and study this phenomenon, we have assembled the Event Horizon Telescope, a global very long baseline interferometry array observing at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. This allows us to reconstruct event-horizon-scale images of the supermassive black hole candidate in the center of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. We have resolved the central compact radio source as an asymmetric bright emission ring with a diameter of 42 ± 3 μas, which is circular and encompasses a central depression in brightness with a flux ratio ≳10:1. The emission ring is recovered using different calibration and imaging schemes, with its diameter and width remaining stable over four different observations carried out in different days. Overall, the observed image is consistent with expectations for the shadow of a Kerr black hole as predicted by general relativity. The asymmetry in brightness in the ring can be explained in terms of relativistic beaming of the emission from a plasma rotating close to the speed of light around a black hole. We compare our images to an extensive library of ray-traced general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black holes and derive a central mass of M = (6.5 ± 0.7) × 109 M⊙. Our radio-wave observations thus provide powerful evidence for the presence of supermassive black holes in centers of galaxies and as the central engines of active galactic nuclei. They also present a new tool to explore gravity in its most extreme limit and on a mass scale that was so far not accessible.},

  abstract = {Theoretical uncertainty limits our ability to extract cosmological information from baryonic fields such as the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. Being sourced by the electron pressure field, the tSZ effect depends on baryonic physics that is usually modeled by expensive hydrodynamic simulations. We train neural networks on the IllustrisTNG-300 cosmological simulation to predict the continuous electron pressure field in galaxy clusters from gravity-only simulations. Modeling clusters is challenging for neural networks as most of the gas pressure is concentrated in a handful of voxels and even the largest hydrodynamical simulations contain only a few hundred clusters that can be used for training. Instead of conventional convolutional neural net (CNN) architectures, we choose to employ a rotationally equivariant DeepSets architecture to operate directly on the set of dark matter particles. We argue that set-based architectures provide distinct advantages over CNNs. For example, we can enforce exact rotational and permutation equivariance, incorporate existing knowledge on the tSZ field, and work with sparse fields as are standard in cosmology. We compose our architecture with separate, physically meaningful modules, making it amenable to interpretation. For example, we can separately study the influence of local and cluster-scale environment, determine that cluster triaxiality has negligible impact, and train a module that corrects for mis-centering. Our model improves by 70 \% on analytic profiles fit to the same simulation data. We argue that the electron pressure field, viewed as a function of a gravity-only simulation, has inherent stochasticity, and model this property through a conditional-VAE extension to the network. This modification yields further improvement by 7 \%, it is limited by our small training set however. (abridged)},

Genetic search for tree-like programs at the population level is complemented by the optimization of terminal values at the individual level. Local adaptation of individuals is made easier by algorithmic differentiation. We show how conventional random constants are tuned by gradient descent with minimal overhead. Several experiments with symbolic regression problems are performed to demonstrate the approach's effectiveness. Effects of local learning are clearly manifest in both improved approximation accuracy and selection changes when periods of local and global search are interleaved. Special attention is paid to the low overhead of the local gradient descent. Finally, the inductive bias of local learning is quantified.},

Such a relation is first sought in nearby calibration galaxies of the Local Group, the M 81 group, and the M 101 group, with well-determined distances, accurately known photometric properties, and accurately known global hydrogen profile width. On the basis of these calibration magnitude-global profile width and diameter-global profile width relationships, distances were derived for the Virgo cluster and the Ursa Major cluster. The distance moduli obtained are 30.6 m for the Virgo cluster and 30.5 m for the Ursa Major cluster. The result for the Virgo cluster suggests a Hubble constant of 80 km per sec per Mpc.},

It improves on the previous state-of-the-art by typically being orders of magnitude more robust toward noise and bad data, and also by discovering many formulas that stumped previous methods. We develop a method for discovering generalized symmetries (arbitrary modularity in the computational graph of a formula) from gradient properties of a neural network fit. We use normalizing flows to generalize our symbolic regression method to probability distributions from which we only have samples, and employ statistical hypothesis testing to accelerate robust brute-force search.},

  abstract = {Galactic winds are observed in many spiral galaxies with sizes from dwarfs up to the Milky Way, and they sometimes carry a mass in excess of that of newly formed stars by up to a factor of 10. Multiple driving processes of such winds have been proposed, including thermal pressure due to supernova heating, ultraviolet radiation pressure on dust grains or cosmic ray (CR) pressure. We here study wind formation due to CR physics using a numerical model that accounts for CR acceleration by supernovae, CR thermalization by Coulomb and hadronic interactions, and advective CR transport. In addition, we introduce a novel implementation of CR streaming relative to the rest frame of the gas. Streaming CRs excite Alfvén waves on which they scatter, thereby limiting the CRs' effective bulk velocity. We find that CR streaming drives powerful and sustained winds in galaxies with virial masses ?. In dwarf galaxies (?) the winds reach a mass loading factor of ̃5, expel ̃60 per cent of the initial baryonic mass contained inside the halo's virial radius and suppress the star formation rate by a factor of ̃5. In dwarfs, the winds are spherically symmetric while in larger galaxies the outflows transition to biconical morphologies that are aligned with the disc's angular momentum axis. We show that damping of Alfvén waves excited by streaming CRs provides a means of heating the outflows to temperatures that scale with the square of the escape speed, ?. In larger haloes (?), CR streaming is able to drive fountain flows that excite turbulence, providing another means of heating the halo gas. For halo masses ?, we predict an observable level of Hα and X-ray emission from the heated halo gas. We conclude that CR-driven winds should be crucial in suppressing and regulating the first epoch of galaxy formation, expelling a large fraction of baryons, and - by extension - aid in shaping the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function. They should then also be responsible for much of the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium.},

In this work we apply modern ML methods to gravity models of pairwise interactions in international economics. We explain the formulation of graphical neural networks (GNNs), models for graph-structured data that respect the properties of exchangeability and locality. GNNs are a natural and theoretically appealing class of models for international trade, which we demonstrate empirically by fitting them to a large panel of annual-frequency country-level data. We then use a symbolic regression algorithm to turn our fits into interpretable models with performance comparable to state of the art hand-crafted models motivated by economic theory. The resulting symbolic models contain objects resembling market access functions, which were developed in modern structural literature, but in our analysis arise ab initio without being explicitly postulated. Along the way, we also produce several model-consistent and model-agnostic ML-based measures of bilateral trade accessibility.},

Here we present an unsupervised method to search for anomalous time series in real time for transient, multivariate, and aperiodic signals. We use a RNN-based variational autoencoder to encode supernova time series and an isolation forest to search for anomalous events in the learned encoded space. We apply this method to a simulated dataset of 12,159 supernovae, successfully discovering anomalous supernovae and objects with catastrophically incorrect redshift measurements.

Here we present a variational recurrent autoencoder neural network to encode simulated Rubin Observatory extragalactic transient events using 1\% of the PLAsTiCC dataset to train the autoencoder. Our unsupervised method uniquely works with unlabeled, real time, multivariate and aperiodic data. We rank 1,129,184 events based on an anomaly score estimated using an isolation forest. We find that our pipeline successfully ranks rarer classes of transients as more anomalous. Using simple cuts in anomaly score and uncertainty, we identify a pure (\textasciitilde 95\% pure) sample of rare transients (i.e., transients other than Type Ia, Type II and Type Ibc supernovae) including superluminous and pair-instability supernovae. Finally, our algorithm is able to identify these transients as anomalous well before peak, enabling real-time follow up studies in the era of the Rubin Observatory.},

Differently from traditional EAs where variation acts blindly, GOMEA learns a model of interdependencies within the genotype, i.e., the linkage, to estimate what patterns to propagate. In this article, we study the role of Linkage Learning (LL) performed by GOMEA in Symbolic Regression (SR). We show that the non-uniformity in the distribution of the genotype in GP populations negatively biases LL, and propose a method to correct for this. We also propose approaches to improve LL when ephemeral random constants are used. Furthermore, we adapt a scheme of interleaving runs to alleviate the burden of tuning the population size, a crucial parameter for LL, to SR. We run experiments on 10 real-world datasets, enforcing a strict limitation on solution size, to enable interpretability. We find that the new LL method outperforms the standard one, and that GOMEA outperforms both traditional and semantic GP. We also find that the small solutions evolved by GOMEA are competitive with tuned decision trees, making GOMEA a promising new approach to SR.},

In this paper, we propose an approach for the synthesis of models that are tailored to the user by enabling the user to steer the model synthesis process according to her or his preferences. We use a bi-objective evolutionary algorithm to synthesize models with trade-offs between accuracy and a user-specific notion of interpretability. The latter is estimated by a neural network that is trained concurrently to the evolution using the feedback of the user, which is collected using uncertainty-based active learning. To maximize usability, the user is only asked to tell, given two models at the time, which one is less complex. With experiments on two real-world datasets involving 61 participants, we find that our approach is capable of learning estimations of interpretability that can be very different for different users. Moreover, the users tend to prefer models found using the proposed approach over models found using non-personalized interpretability indices.},

  abstract = {The Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GOMEA) is a recently introduced model-based EA that has been shown to be capable of outperforming state-of-the-art alternative EAs in terms of scalability when solving discrete optimization problems. One of the key aspects of GOMEA's success is a variation operator that is designed to extensively exploit linkage models by effectively combining partial solutions. Here, we bring the strengths of GOMEA to Genetic Programming (GP), introducing GP-GOMEA. Under the hypothesis of having little problem-specific knowledge, and in an effort to design easy-to-use EAs, GP-GOMEA requires no parameter specification. On a set of well-known benchmark problems we find that GP-GOMEA outperforms standard GP while being on par with more recently introduced, state-of-the-art EAs. We furthermore introduce Input-space Entropy-based Building-block Learning (IEBL), a novel approach to identifying and encapsulating relevant building blocks (subroutines) into new terminals and functions. On problems with an inherent degree of modularity, IEBL can contribute to compact solution representations, providing a large potential for knock-on effects in performance. On the difficult, but highly modular Even Parity problem, GP-GOMEA+IEBL obtains excellent scalability, solving the 14-bit instance in less than 1 hour.},

By their nature, SR models have the potential to be accurate and human-interpretable at the same time. Unfortunately, finding such models, i.e., performing SR, appears to be a computationally intensive task. Historically, SR has been tackled with heuristics such as greedy or genetic algorithms and, while some works have hinted at the possible hardness of SR, no proof has yet been given that SR is, in fact, NP-hard. This begs the question: Is there an exact polynomial-time algorithm to compute SR models? We provide evidence suggesting that the answer is probably negative by showing that SR is NP-hard.},

  abstract = {Complex systems (stars, supernovae, galaxies, and clusters) often exhibit low scatter relations between observable properties (e.g., luminosity, velocity dispersion, oscillation period, temperature). These scaling relations can illuminate the underlying physics and can provide observational tools for estimating masses and distances. Machine learning can provide a systematic way to search for new scaling relations (or for simple extensions to existing relations) in abstract high-dimensional parameter spaces. We use a machine learning tool called symbolic regression (SR), which models the patterns in a given dataset in the form of analytic equations. We focus on the Sunyaev-Zeldovich flux\$-\$cluster mass relation (\$Y\_\textbackslash mathrm\{SZ\}-M\$), the scatter in which affects inference of cosmological parameters from cluster abundance data. Using SR on the data from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation, we find a new proxy for cluster mass which combines \$Y\_\textbackslash mathrm\{SZ\}\$ and concentration of ionized gas (\$c\_\textbackslash mathrm\{gas\}\$): \$M \textbackslash propto Y\_\textbackslash mathrm\{conc\}\^\{3/5\} \textbackslash equiv Y\_\textbackslash mathrm\{SZ\}\^\{3/5\} (1-A\textbackslash, c\_\textbackslash mathrm\{gas\})\$. \$Y\_\textbackslash mathrm\{conc\}\$ reduces the scatter in the predicted \$M\$ by \$\textbackslash sim 20-30\$\% for large clusters (\$M\textbackslash gtrsim 10\^\{14\}\textbackslash, h\^\{-1\} \textbackslash, M\_\textbackslash odot\$) at both high and low redshifts, as compared to using just \$Y\_\textbackslash mathrm\{SZ\}\$. We show that the dependence on \$c\_\textbackslash mathrm\{gas\}\$ is linked to cores of clusters exhibiting larger scatter than their outskirts. Finally, we test \$Y\_\textbackslash mathrm\{conc\}\$ on clusters from simulations of the CAMELS project and show that \$Y\_\textbackslash mathrm\{conc\}\$ is robust against variations in cosmology, astrophysics, subgrid physics, and cosmic variance. Our results and methodology can be useful for accurate multiwavelength cluster mass estimation from current and upcoming CMB and X-ray surveys like ACT, SO, SPT, eROSITA and CMB-S4.},

Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and supernovae can affect the measurements of the integrated tSZ flux of halos (\$Y\_\textbackslash mathrm\{SZ\}\$) and cause its relation with the halo mass (\$Y\_\textbackslash mathrm\{SZ\}-M\$) to deviate from the self-similar power-law prediction of the virial theorem. We perform a comprehensive study of such deviations using CAMELS, a suite of hydrodynamic simulations with extensive variations in feedback prescriptions. We use a combination of two machine learning tools (random forest and symbolic regression) to search for analogues of the \$Y-M\$ relation which are more robust to feedback processes for low masses (\$M\textbackslash lesssim 10\^\{14\}\textbackslash, h\^\{-1\} \textbackslash, M\_\textbackslash odot\$); we find that simply replacing \$Y\textbackslash rightarrow Y(1+M\_*/M\_\textbackslash mathrm\{gas\})\$ in the relation makes it remarkably self-similar. This could serve as a robust multiwavelength mass proxy for low-mass clusters and galaxy groups. Our methodology can also be generally useful to improve the domain of validity of other astrophysical scaling relations. We also forecast that measurements of the \$Y-M\$ relation could provide percent-level constraints on certain combinations of feedback parameters and/or rule out a major part of the parameter space of supernova and AGN feedback models used in current state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations. Our results can be useful for using upcoming SZ surveys (e.g. SO, CMB-S4) and galaxy surveys (e.g. DESI and Rubin) to constrain the nature of baryonic feedback. Finally, we find that the an alternative relation, \$Y-M\_*\$, provides complementary information on feedback than \$Y-M\$.},

  abstract = {A set of numerical methods has been devised to deal with the special needs of a parameter study on hydrostatic Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) evolution at a high degree of accuracy. The aim is to provide a grid of initial models for AGB-sequences starting at different total masses M\_*\_ and core masses M\_c\_ as parameters (and later on (Y,Z,α\_MLT\_) as well). These models are intended to be used as the inner part of self-consistent stellar models with realistic atmospheres including dust-driven winds. Since thermally pulsing (TP-)AGB models are always physically and numerically close to instability, the code was designed to be both highly reliable and accurate. With the methods published here we believe that we have overcome most of the notorious numerical difficulties of TP-AGB evolution. We computed 11 complete, straightforward evolutionary sequences with initial masses in the range 0.8 to 7.0 Msun\_ from the ZAMS up to and along the AGB through numerous pulses with both a high spatial and temporal resolution. We also present less accurate, but fast techniques to transform given AGB models into others with (a) smaller total mass to mimic the evolution of a star with less initial mass and/or (b) heavier cores to avoid the detailed computation of thermal pulses. The variation of the main global stellar parameters (such as luminosity maxima and interpulse period) both as a function of core mass within a single sequence and as a function of total mass turns out to be very smooth and hence can be used to check the consistency of such artificial models. Additionally, the initial core mass and the behaviour of the maximum helium luminosity in a pulse are functions of the initial mass.

  abstract = {Today numerous variants of heuristic optimization algorithms are used to solve different kinds of optimization problems. This huge variety makes it very difficult to reuse already implemented algorithms or problems. In this paper the authors describe a generic, extensible, and paradigm-independent optimization environment that strongly abstracts the process of heuristic optimization. By providing a well organized and strictly separated class structure and by introducing a generic operator concept for the interaction between algorithms and problems, HeuristicLab makes it possible to reuse an algorithm implementation for the attacking of lots of different kinds of problems and vice versa. Consequently HeuristicLab is very well suited for rapid prototyping of new algorithms and is also useful for educational support due to its state-of-the-art user interface, its self-explanatory API and the use of modern programming concepts.},

  abstract = {Point clouds provide a flexible and scalable geometric representation suitable for countless applications in computer graphics; they also comprise the raw output of most 3D data acquisition devices. Hence, the design of intelligent computational models that act directly on point clouds is critical, especially when efficiency considerations or noise preclude the possibility of expensive denoising and meshing procedures. While hand-designed features on point clouds have long been proposed in graphics and vision, however, the recent overwhelming success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis suggests the value of adapting insight from CNN to the point cloud world. To this end, we propose a new neural network module dubbed EdgeConv suitable for CNN-based high-level tasks on point clouds including classification and segmentation. EdgeConv is differentiable and can be plugged into existing architectures. Compared to existing modules operating largely in extrinsic space or treating each point independently, EdgeConv has several appealing properties: It incorporates local neighborhood information; it can be stacked or recurrently applied to learn global shape properties; and in multi-layer systems affinity in feature space captures semantic characteristics over potentially long distances in the original embedding. Beyond proposing this module, we provide extensive evaluation and analysis revealing that EdgeConv captures and exploits fine-grained geometric properties of point clouds. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks including ModelNet40 and S3DIS.},

In traditional reinforcement learning, policies of agents are learned by MLPs which take the concatenation of all observations from the environment as input for predicting actions. In this work, we propose NerveNet to explicitly model the structure of an agent, which naturally takes the form of a graph. Specifically, serving as the agent's policy network, NerveNet first propagates information over the structure of the agent and then predict actions for different parts of the agent. In the experiments, we first show that our NerveNet is comparable to state-of-the-art methods on standard MuJoCo environments. We further propose our customized reinforcement learning environments for benchmarking two types of structure transfer learning tasks, i.e., size and disability transfer. We demonstrate that policies learned by NerveNet are significantly better than policies learned by other models and are able to transfer even in a zero-shot setting.},

We discuss works on curriculum learning within a general CL framework, elaborating on how to design a manually predefined curriculum or an automatic curriculum. In particular, we summarize existing CL designs based on the general framework of Difficulty Measurer+Training Scheduler and further categorize the methodologies for automatic CL into four groups, i.e., Self-paced Learning, Transfer Teacher, RL Teacher, and Other Automatic CL. We also analyze principles to select different CL designs that may benefit practical applications. Finally, we present our insights on the relationships connecting CL and other machine learning concepts including transfer learning, meta-learning, continual learning and active learning, etc., then point out challenges in CL as well as potential future research directions deserving further investigations.},

Machine learning models trained with numerical simulation data can provide a faster alternative to traditional simulators. Here we present U-FNO, a novel neural network architecture for solving multiphase flow problems with superior accuracy, speed, and data efficiency. U-FNO is designed based on the newly proposed Fourier neural operator (FNO), which has shown excellent performance in single-phase flows. We extend the FNO-based architecture to a highly complex CO2-water multiphase problem with wide ranges of permeability and porosity heterogeneity, anisotropy, reservoir conditions, injection configurations, flow rates, and multiphase flow properties. The U-FNO architecture is more accurate in gas saturation and pressure buildup predictions than the original FNO and a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) benchmark. Meanwhile, it has superior data utilization efficiency, requiring only a third of the training data to achieve the equivalent accuracy as CNN. U-FNO provides superior performance in highly heterogeneous geological formations and critically important applications such as gas saturation and pressure buildup “fronts” determination. The trained model can serve as a general-purpose alternative to routine numerical simulations of 2D-radial CO2 injection problems with significant speed-ups than traditional simulators.},

  abstract = {Distilling data into compact and interpretable analytic equations is one of the goals of science. Instead, contemporary supervised machine learning methods mostly produce unstructured and dense maps from input to output. Particularly in deep learning, this property is owed to the generic nature of simple standard link functions. To learn equations rather than maps, standard non-linearities can be replaced with structured building blocks of atomic functions. However, without strong priors on sparsity and structure, representational complexity and numerical conditioning limit this direct approach. To scale to realistic settings in science and engineering, we propose an informed equation learning system. It provides a way to incorporate expert knowledge about what are permitted or prohibited equation components, as well as a domain-dependent structured sparsity prior. Our system then utilizes a robust method to learn equations with atomic functions exhibiting singularities, as e.g. logarithm and division. We demonstrate several artificial and real-world experiments from the engineering domain, in which our system learns interpretable models of high predictive power.},

  abstract = {Low-mass “dwarf” galaxies represent the most significant  challenges to the cold dark matter (CDM) model of cosmological structure formation. Because these faint galaxies are (best) observed within the Local Group (LG) of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31), understanding their formation in such an environment is critical. We present first results from the Latte Project: the Milky Way on Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE). This simulation models the formation of an MW-mass galaxy to z=0 within ΛCDM cosmology, including dark matter, gas, and stars at unprecedented resolution: baryon particle mass of 7070 \{M\}⊙ with gas kernel/softening that adapts down to 1 \{pc\} (with a median of 25\{--\}60 \{pc\} at z=0). Latte was simulated using the GIZMO code with a mesh-free method for accurate hydrodynamics and the FIRE-2 model for star formation and explicit feedback within a multi-phase interstellar medium. For the first time, Latte self-consistently resolves the spatial scales corresponding to half-light radii of dwarf galaxies that form around an MW-mass host down to \{M\}\{star\}≳ \{10\}5 \{M\}⊙ . Latte’s population of dwarf galaxies agrees with the LG across a broad range of properties: (1) distributions of stellar masses and stellar velocity dispersions (dynamical masses), including their joint relation; (2) the mass-metallicity relation; and (3) diverse range of star formation histories, including their mass dependence. Thus, Latte produces a realistic population of dwarf galaxies at \{M\}\{star\}≳ \{10\}5 \{M\}⊙ that does not suffer from the “missing satellites” or “too big to fail” problems of small-scale structure formation. We conclude that baryonic physics can reconcile observed dwarf galaxies with standard ΛCDM cosmology.},

  abstract = {Free energy perturbation (FEP) was proposed by Zwanzig [J. Chem. Phys. 22, 1420 (1954)] more than six decades ago as a method to estimate free energy differences and has since inspired a huge body of related methods that use it as an integral building block. Being an importance sampling based estimator, however, FEP suffers from a severe limitation: the requirement of sufficient overlap between distributions. One strategy to mitigate this problem, called Targeted FEP, uses a high-dimensional mapping in configuration space to increase the overlap of the underlying distributions. Despite its potential, this method has attracted only limited attention due to the formidable challenge of formulating a tractable mapping. Here, we cast Targeted FEP as a machine learning problem in which the mapping is parameterized as a neural network that is optimized so as to increase the overlap. We develop a new model architecture that respects permutational and periodic symmetries often encountered in atomistic simulations and test our method on a fully periodic solvation system. We demonstrate that our method leads to a substantial variance reduction in free energy estimates when compared against baselines, without requiring any additional data.},

As more gravitational-wave (GW) events are detected, flexible models such as Gaussian Mixture Models have become more important in fitting the distribution of GW properties due to their expressivity. However, flexible models come with many parameters that lack physical motivation, making interpreting the implication of these models challenging. In this work, we demonstrate symbolic regression can complement flexible models by distilling the posterior predictive distribution of such flexible models into interpretable analytic expressions. We recover common GW population models such as a power-law-plus-Gaussian, and find a new empirical population model which combines accuracy and simplicity. This demonstrates a strategy to automatically discover interpretable population models in the ever-growing GW catalog, which can potentially be applied to other astrophysical phenomena.},

Particular attention was focused on the variation in surface luminosity resulting from the flash, since the peak surface luminosity during the flash cycle plays an important role in determining the termination point of asymptotic giant branch evolution. It was found that both the peak in surface luminosity at the flash (LP) and the quiescent luminosity maximum (LQ) occurring between each shell flash increase linearly with core mass. However, LP and LQ are shown to be independent of total stellar mass in the range of masses studied because envelope convection does not penetrate far enough into the star. Formulae are given for the dependence on Mc of LP, LQ, the interpulse period, and the length of the interval during which the surface luminosity at the flash exceeds the quiescent maximum. Approximate formulae for the time dependence of the surface luminosity are also given. Rates of period change in the Mira variables R Hya, R Aql, and W Dra are compared with rates of change predicted by theoretical flash calculations and, as a result, constraints on the luminosity of these stars are derived via the theoretical relation between luminosity and rate of change of luminosity. The luminosities thus derived for R Hya and R Aql are compared with luminosities derived from pulsation theory.},

We address these problems through global 3-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including the entire spherical He-shell flash convection zone (as oposed to the 3D box-in-a-star simulations). An important aspect of our current effort is to establish the feasibility of our appoach. We explain why we favour the explicit treatment over the anelastic approximation for this problem. The simulations presented in this paper use a Cartesian grid of 512\^3 cells and have been run on four 8-core workstations for four days to simulate \textasciitilde 5000s, which corresponds to almost ten convective turn-over times. The convection layer extends radially at the simulated point in the flash evolution over 7 H\_p pressure scale-heights and exceeds the size of the underlying core. Convection is dominated by large convective cells that fill more than an entire octant. [...]},

  abstract = {We present the first three-dimensional, fully compressible gas-dynamics simulations in 4π geometry of He-shell flash convection with proton-rich fuel entrainment at the upper boundary. This work is motivated by the insufficiently understood observed consequences of the H-ingestion flash in post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars (Sakurai's object) and metal-poor AGB stars. Our investigation is focused on the entrainment process at the top convection boundary and on the subsequent advection of H-rich material into deeper layers, and we therefore ignore the burning of the proton-rich fuel in this study. We find that for our deep convection zone, coherent convective motions of near global scale appear to dominate the flow. At the top boundary convective shear flows are stable against Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. However, such shear instabilities are induced by the boundary-layer separation in large-scale, opposing flows. This links the global nature of thick shell convection with the entrainment process. We establish the quantitative dependence of the entrainment rate on grid resolution. With our numerical technique, simulations with 1024\textsuperscript{3} cells or more are required to reach a numerical fidelity appropriate for this problem. However, only the result from the 1536\textsuperscript{3} simulation provides a clear indication that we approach convergence with regard to the entrainment rate. Our results demonstrate that our method, which is described in detail, can provide quantitative results related to entrainment and convective boundary mixing in deep stellar interior environments with very stiff convective boundaries. For the representative case we study in detail, we find an entrainment rate of 4.38 ± 1.48 × 10\textsuperscript{-13} M \textsubscript{☉} s\textsuperscript{-1}.},

PGE maintains the tree-based representation and Pareto non-dominated sorting from Genetic Programming (GP), but replaces genetic operators and random number use with grammar production rules and systematic choices. PGE uses non-linear regression and abstract parameters to fit the coefficients of an equation, effectively separating the exploration for form, from the optimization of a form. Memoization enables PGE to evaluate each point of the search space only once, and a Pareto Priority Queue provides direction to the search. Sorting and simplification algorithms are used to transform candidate expressions into a canonical form, reducing the size of the search space. Our results show that PGE performs well on 22 benchmarks from the SR literature, returning exact formulas in many cases. As a deterministic algorithm, PGE offers reliability and reproducibility of results, a key aspect to any system used by scientists at large. We believe PGE is a capable SR implementation, following an alternative perspective we hope leads the community to new ideas.},

  abstract = {We investigate opportunities and challenges for improving unsupervised machine learning using four common strategies with a long history in physics: divide-and-conquer, Occam's Razor, unification, and lifelong learning. Instead of using one model to learn everything, we propose a novel paradigm centered around the learning and manipulation of *theories*, which parsimoniously predict both aspects of the future (from past observations) and the domain in which these predictions are accurate. Specifically, we propose a novel generalized-mean-loss to encourage each theory to specialize in its comparatively advantageous domain, and a differentiable description length objective to downweight bad data and "snap" learned theories into simple symbolic formulas. Theories are stored in a "theory hub", which continuously unifies learned theories and can propose theories when encountering new environments. We test our implementation, the "AI Physicist" learning agent, on a suite of increasingly complex physics environments. From unsupervised observation of trajectories through worlds involving random combinations of gravity, electromagnetism, harmonic motion and elastic bounces, our agent typically learns faster and produces mean-squared prediction errors about a billion times smaller than a standard feedforward neural net of comparable complexity, typically recovering integer and rational theory parameters exactly. Our agent successfully identifies domains with different laws of motion also for a nonlinear chaotic double pendulum in a piecewise constant force field.},

  abstract = {We present multi-colour time-series CCD photometry of the solar-age galactic open cluster M 67 (NGC 2682). About 3600 frames spread over 28 nights were obtained with the 1.5 m Russian-Turkish and 1.2 m Mercator telescopes. High-precision observations of the close binary stars AH Cnc, EV Cnc, ES Cnc, the δ Scuti type systems EX Cnc and EW Cnc, and some long-period variables belonging to M 67 are presented. Three full multi-colour light curves of the overcontact binary AH Cnc were obtained during three observing seasons. Likewise we gathered three light curves of EV Cnc, an EB-type binary, and two light curves of ES Cnc, a blue straggler binary. Parts of the light change of long-term variables S1024, S1040, S1045, S1063, S1242, and S1264 are obtained. Period variation analysis of AH Cnc, EV Cnc, and ES Cnc were done using all times of mid-eclipse available in the literature and those obtained in this study. In addition, we analyzed multi-colour light curves of the close binaries and also determined new frequencies for the δ Scuti systems. The physical parameters of the close binary stars were determined with simultaneous solutions of multi-colour light and radial velocity curves. Finally we determined the distance of M 67 as 857(33) pc via binary star parameters, which is consistent with an independent method from earlier studies. Based on observations made with the Mercator Telescope, operated on the island of La Palma by the Flemish Community, at the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias and TÜBİTAK National Observatory Russian-Turkish telescope operated at Saklıkent, Antalya.},

According to the decentralized resource allocation mechanism, an autonomous “agent,” a V2V link or a vehicle, makes its decisions to find the optimal sub-band and power level for transmission without requiring or having to wait for global information. Since the proposed method is decentralized, it incurs only limited transmission overhead. From the simulation results, each agent can effectively learn to satisfy the stringent latency constraints on V2V links while minimizing the interference to vehicle-to-infrastructure communications.},

  abstract = {Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the field of graph representation learning through effectively learned node embeddings, and achieved state-of-the-art results in tasks such as node classification and link prediction. However, current GNN methods are inherently flat and do not learn hierarchical representations of graphs---a limitation that is especially problematic for the task of graph classification, where the goal is to predict the label associated with an entire graph. Here we propose DiffPool, a differentiable graph pooling module that can generate hierarchical representations of graphs and can be combined with various graph neural network architectures in an end-to-end fashion. DiffPool learns a differentiable soft cluster assignment for nodes at each layer of a deep GNN, mapping nodes to a set of clusters, which then form the coarsened input for the next GNN layer. Our experimental results show that combining existing GNN methods with DiffPool yields an average improvement of 5-10\% accuracy on graph classification benchmarks, compared to all existing pooling approaches, achieving a new state-of-the-art on four out of five benchmark data sets.},

  abstract = {Background There is interest in using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze medical imaging to provide computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Recent work has suggested that image classification CNNs may not generalize to new data as well as previously believed. We assessed how well CNNs generalized across three hospital systems for a simulated pneumonia screening task. Methods and findings A cross-sectional design with multiple model training cohorts was used to evaluate model generalizability to external sites using split-sample validation. A total of 158,323 chest radiographs were drawn from three institutions: National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (NIH; 112,120 from 30,805 patients), Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH; 42,396 from 12,904 patients), and Indiana University Network for Patient Care (IU; 3,807 from 3,683 patients). These patient populations had an age mean (SD) of 46.9 years (16.6), 63.2 years (16.5), and 49.6 years (17) with a female percentage of 43.5\%, 44.8\%, and 57.3\%, respectively. We assessed individual models using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for radiographic findings consistent with pneumonia and compared performance on different test sets with DeLong’s test. The prevalence of pneumonia was high enough at MSH (34.2\%) relative to NIH and IU (1.2\% and 1.0\%) that merely sorting by hospital system achieved an AUC of 0.861 (95\% CI 0.855–0.866) on the joint MSH–NIH dataset. Models trained on data from either NIH or MSH had equivalent performance on IU (P values 0.580 and 0.273, respectively) and inferior performance on data from each other relative to an internal test set (i.e., new data from within the hospital system used for training data; P values both {$<$}0.001). The highest internal performance was achieved by combining training and test data from MSH and NIH (AUC 0.931, 95\% CI 0.927–0.936), but this model demonstrated significantly lower external performance at IU (AUC 0.815, 95\% CI 0.745–0.885, P = 0.001). To test the effect of pooling data from sites with disparate pneumonia prevalence, we used stratified subsampling to generate MSH–NIH cohorts that only differed in disease prevalence between training data sites. When both training data sites had the same pneumonia prevalence, the model performed consistently on external IU data (P = 0.88). When a 10-fold difference in pneumonia rate was introduced between sites, internal test performance improved compared to the balanced model (10× MSH risk P {$<$} 0.001; 10× NIH P = 0.002), but this outperformance failed to generalize to IU (MSH 10× P {$<$} 0.001; NIH 10× P = 0.027). CNNs were able to directly detect hospital system of a radiograph for 99.95\% NIH (22,050/22,062) and 99.98\% MSH (8,386/8,388) radiographs. The primary limitation of our approach and the available public data is that we cannot fully assess what other factors might be contributing to hospital system–specific biases. Conclusion Pneumonia-screening CNNs achieved better internal than external performance in 3 out of 5 natural comparisons. When models were trained on pooled data from sites with different pneumonia prevalence, they performed better on new pooled data from these sites but not on external data. CNNs robustly identified hospital system and department within a hospital, which can have large differences in disease burden and may confound predictions.},

  abstract = {Systems that discover empirical equations from data require large scale testing to become a reliable research tool. In the central part of this paper we discuss two convergence tests for large scale evaluation of equation finders and we demonstrate that our system, which we introduce earlier, has the desired convergence properties. Our system can detect a broad range of equations useful in different sciences, and can be easily expanded by addition of new variable transformations. Previous systems, such as BACON or ABACUS, disregarded or oversimplified the problems of error analysis and error propagation, leading to paradoxical results and impeding the true world applications. Our system treats experimental error in a systematic and statistically sound manner. It propagates error to the transformed variables and assigns error to parameters in equations. It uses errors in weighted least squares fitting, in the evaluation of equations, including their acceptance, rejection and ranking, and uses parameter error to eliminate spurious parameters. The system detects equivalent terms (variables) and equations, and it removes the repetitions. This is important for convergence tests and system efficiency. Thanks to the modular structure, our system can be easily expanded, modified, and used to simulate other equation finders.},

However, existing CoT studies have focused on the language modality. We propose Multimodal-CoT that incorporates language (text) and vision (images) modalities into a two-stage framework that separates rationale generation and answer inference. In this way, answer inference can leverage better generated rationales that are based on multimodal information. With Multimodal-CoT, our model under 1 billion parameters outperforms the previous state-of-the-art LLM (GPT-3.5) by 16 percentage points (75.17\%-{$>$}91.68\% accuracy) on the ScienceQA benchmark and even surpasses human performance.

  abstract = {Crowd simulation acts as the basic component in traffic management, urban planning, and emergency management. Most existing approaches use physics-based models due to their robustness and strong generalizability, yet they fall short in fidelity since human behaviors are too complex and heterogeneous for a universal physical model to describe. Recent research tries to solve this problem by deep learning methods. However, they are still unable to generalize well beyond training distributions. In this work, we propose to jointly leverage the strength of the physical and neural network models for crowd simulation by a Physics-Infused Machine Learning (PIML) framework. The key idea is to let the two models learn from each other by iteratively going through a physics-informed machine learning process and a machine-learning-aided physics discovery process. We present our realization of the framework with a novel neural network model, Physics-informed Crowd Simulator (PCS), and tailored interaction mechanisms enabling the two models to facilitate each other. Specifically, our designs enable the neural network model to identify generalizable signals from real-world data better and yield physically consistent simulations with the physical model's form and simulation results as a prior. Further, by performing symbolic regression on the well-trained neural network, we obtain improved physical models that better describe crowd dynamics. Extensive experiments on two publicly available large-scale real-world datasets show that, with the framework, we successfully obtain a neural network model with strong generalizability and a new physical model with valid physical meanings at the same time. Both models outperform existing state-of-the-art simulation methods in accuracy, fidelity, and generalizability, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the PIML framework for improving simulation performance and its capability for facilitating scientific discovery and deepening our understandings of crowd dynamics. We release the codes at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/PIML.},

  abstract = {Recent studies on Learning to Optimize (L2O) suggest a promising path to automating and accelerating the optimization procedure for complicated tasks. Existing L2O models parameterize optimization rules by neural networks, and learn those numerical rules via meta-training. However, they face two common pitfalls: (1) scalability: the numerical rules represented by neural networks create extra memory overhead for applying L2O models, and limit their applicability to optimizing larger tasks; (2) interpretability: it is unclear what an L2O model has learned in its black-box optimization rule, nor is it straightforward to compare different L2O models in an explainable way. To avoid both pitfalls, this paper proves the concept that we can "kill two birds by one stone", by introducing the powerful tool of symbolic regression to L2O. In this paper, we establish a holistic symbolic representation and analysis framework for L2O, which yields a series of insights for learnable optimizers. Leveraging our findings, we further propose a lightweight L2O model that can be meta-trained on large-scale problems and outperformed human-designed and tuned optimizers. Our work is set to supply a brand-new perspective to L2O research. Codes are available at: https://github.com/VITA-Group/Symbolic-Learning-To-Optimize.},

Sparse regression in particular has been instrumental in scientific model discovery, including compressed sensing applications, variable selection, and high-dimensional analysis. We propose a broad framework for sparse relaxed regularized regression, called SR3. The key idea is to solve a relaxation of the regularized problem, which has three advantages over the state-of-the-art: (1) solutions of the relaxed problem are superior with respect to errors, false positives, and conditioning, (2) relaxation allows extremely fast algorithms for both convex and nonconvex formulations, and (3) the methods apply to composite regularizers such as total variation (TV) and its nonconvex variants. We demonstrate the advantages of SR3 (computational efficiency, higher accuracy, faster convergence rates, greater flexibility) across a range of regularized regression problems with synthetic and real data, including applications in compressed sensing, LASSO, matrix completion, TV regularization, and group sparsity. To promote reproducible research, we also provide a companion MATLAB package that implements these examples.},

This, in turn, necessitates the development of active learning methods capable of exploring relevant parameter spaces with the smallest number of steps. Here, an active learning approach based on conavigation of the hypothesis and experimental spaces is introduced. This is realized by combining the structured Gaussian processes containing probabilistic models of the possible system's behaviors (hypotheses) with reinforcement learning policy refinement (discovery). This approach closely resembles classical human-driven physical discovery, when several alternative hypotheses realized via models with adjustable parameters are tested during an experiment. This approach is demonstrated for exploring concentration-induced phase transitions in combinatorial libraries of Sm-doped BiFeO3 using piezoresponse force microscopy, but it is straightforward to extend it to higher-dimensional parameter spaces and more complex physical problems once the experimental workflow and hypothesis generation are available.},

  abstract = {We have calculated the dynamics of mass loss from a disk galaxy with the escaping high energy component of the ISM (cosmic rays), and the magnetic field. The coupling between cosmic rays and plasma is provided by the resonant excitation of small-scale magnetic field fluctuations (MHD waves). Earlier work is generalized by including galactic rotation and the resulting magnetic tension of the frozen-in field. It is shown that nonlinear damping of self-excited waves in the galactic halo is significant, thus heating the plasma. We obtain steady-state galactic wind solutions with a moderate enhancement of the galactic mass loss rate in comparison with a non-rotating and undamped model. A qualitative new result of this theory is the determination of the angular momentum loss rate of a galaxy. Due to magnetic stresses, this exceeds the angular momentum carried away by the fluid elements leaving the galaxy. Thus the halo is forced to corotate with the disk up to a vertical distance of a few kiloparsecs, typically. Quantitatively, for our Galaxy, we find that over a Galactic evolution time scale of 10\^10\^ years about 17 to 39 percent of the total angular momentum (including the stellar component) is lost. The corresponding numbers due to magnetic stresses alone are about 2 to 17 percent. Since the star formation rate is likely to have been significantly larger in the past, it seems inevitable that galaxies like ours have lost a significant amount of their present angular momentum.},

	abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

  abstract = {Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from the diverse fields of computer science and computational science to create a new approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to be easy and fast. Julia questions notions generally held as "laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: 1. High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. 2. One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment, and 3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts. We introduce the Julia programming language and its design --- a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can have machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.},
